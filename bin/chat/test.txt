Echo, what's the maximum amount of points one can receive for completing a cube?
And it's based on similarity to other's who've done that cube, and amount filled in right? 
Is that how this guy got 34k?
and yes, unless I'm forgetting how my code works that's the idea vorticidox
what if i add stuff everyone else has missed. I guess it will be regarded as an error
hey, is it true you don't have to colour  the blank 'inside' spots?
SEVEN HOURS?
say that again?
it may be what?
was that the cell body?
echo, i just skipped a cube, gave me 1 point, then 0 points?
so you got two popups?
want me to skip this one? 
am I the only one that gets consequtively the body of the cell?
Is that a bad thing?
And why does the color of my name keep changing back to green?
the AI isn't my focus, I'm not sure what progress that team has made
?
Has the AI even been updated since?
Can you create a paint tool just for those cells specifically that will color in on multiple layers?
I imagine it's not constantly improving ... rather the data we are creating now will be used to teach a new version?
Do we really need to fill every last pixel? Isn't that something that can be done after the fact, when the cell membrane has been so --
obviously reconstructed?
@echo what about exterior pieces which don't lead to new branches? :)
why not 333333 reb?
325k today? I am flattered but do not have the time!
333333? 3's my favorite number but that may finish our cell and I'd get very hungry
@echo any progress on improved tools to find branches?
It took practice, but I got the knack of branches down...it just takes knowing what to look for
sometimes you know what you've got before you see it
echo, did you change the ability to scroll screen left/right (scores on rh side)?
@phdfluff it would basically be an augmented version of what you're doing now
? the fun-ness of the game should be unrelated. :) That's more about organizing competitions as this one and such.
that was fast, eh dwip?
This is why I like this... fast customer service!
do you mean synapses?
@echo also yes, but in this case more on identifying those spot where branches possibly are.
And asking the user, 'does this branch'?
Any advice?
well, the snap would show a cube, on the left, with the slide inside of it, and the slide on the right, with the "hints of what to color in"
Do you currently have graphs running through those?
Cool ... because that's what the 'connection AI' I'd love to see would have to be working on. :)
@echo, I think akio is describing the 'ghost' projections someone got a screenshot of yesterday (perhaps prior concensus?)
Makes sense... you don't want first years thinking they know what they are doing (myself)
you're going to keep us playing forever, arent you?
you can't switch when your score pops up, only overview
Poor hephaestion. You got the message about not needing to fill in the body, right? Just define the membrane
For the bodies, do we fill in the edges that continue into the next cube, or just where the cells end?
I appear to have a by block. Is this normal?
can anyone point me to the forum where it explains maybe, why the 3d part is not staying colored
WHY DID YOU CHANGE YOUR NAME
Wait, why was I green?
auto reset?
I don't see the colored 3d part of the screan, the left side. any advice?
What do you mean?
You can avoid filling in the tiny strips and 3 pixel gaps, and just outline the membranes when it comes to huge cell bodies
Oh Akio, didn't Echo fix that for you earlier?
what did echo say?
You can avoid filling in the tiny strips and 3 pixel gaps, and just outline the membranes when it comes to huge cell bodies
How can that be? Either it is or it isn't
And he'll bring up how to address that in terms of accuracy at their next discussion
won't I get less points for not filling all this is?
Anyone else go a big block in their cube?
Anyone willing to address me?
should I fill in the middle bits?
in forum you intend?
asthma: look at what?
If that happens to me, I'm going to find where these servers are, and smash hem
so when i go to the review, i get a jagged spikey picture
probably your hardware is a little under what we require
a little?
hey echo when I get something like i'm on now, should i worry about filling in all these pieces in the middle?
asthmaticninja, lol you call that a big one? xd mine was almost as big as the whole cube
echo do you know what place in all-time high schores @roditg got yesterday? 33k points. whoa
I have a question, does it look like anybody is working on a starburst cell yet?
motd?
what did I miss?
there's an IRC?
I don't know how to check cubes sorry
so wait..there's IRC or not? I couldn't tell from what echo said if he's got to set that up or something else
so close to having it not lose your work when you refresh
echo: what did you update?
no MOTD when I refreshed
wondering how much I'll get from this giant cube...
dejerpha you on reddit?
are you sure?
Cat-shaped neurons?
Facebook does look cool but they always take them away right when it starts looking good
Your helping FB?
so the real question is, how many mice were harmed in the making of this game?
does anyone know which team @ 1h7k2t9 is on?
did I?
reditg, 1000 again? or not? :p
Hey viper, want to take some of these trailblazers?
I love how large our neuron has grown though
ish echo on?
when i click "move on" it keeps me here
Where be echo?
I need something like 34078 right?
amy, you an admin?
yea @roditg when echo gets back he will check to see where that puts you in all time high scoring
when i click proceed it keeps me here
refresh the page?
could someone send a note with this bug to support@eyewire.org?
1000 points nuts one?
is there a public bug tracker anywhere?
hm..i dont think so. chech w echo when he gets back
How much is FB winning by now?
still by 20?
It's a ballpark figure -- when we calculate the wining team we will only count cubes that you actually traced -- some of the cubes in those 
numbers were spawned automatically by AI. Any cube where no one traced won't count.
hows everyones day?
in what other context would you use the word belated
i can belate to what you just said
is there anyone who can take a quick look?
or you can just skip it?
50 points per trailblaze right?
what is a trailblazer?
when did you guys join? eyewire
nov?
what did i miss?
@andrewb you didn't play all of jan -- what brought you back?
That's what I like to hear!
I took a homework break and this is what happens, fb ahead by 20!
jamie! I see what trailblazing has done to you
uhm, why does it reload the same cube over and over again and I don't get my points?
I propose you deprive yourself of sleep most of the time, then sleep well when you need to perform
Who was dissing y'all?
how
22k points today alone? 
How many hours of work was that?
thats how much i was doing this damned thing
Whats a girl?
how about males? Dudes are a subset I believe
and I follow gaming in general, it's interesting how it changes...though I don't MMOG as much anymore (school is more important atm)...
How do you start a cube?
I always used to play as girl characters to make guys extra mad when i would kick their asses
plus they typically make smaller targets if you are playing a game where that matters
what server did you play viper?
blackout?
?
OP champs?
what i mean is like keep working that dendrite 
that my cube movers ahead of what i just did
anyone play BO2 on pc?
what is BO2?
What's that?
adelso? nope
who was the one saying they were a girl who plays video games?
where do you see the statistics of the players?
You sure you're not in the turotials?
wait..... you mean to tell me other places have internet?
like places with ground?
and electricity?
are there trees in the domincan republic?
lOL?
anyone from antarctica? no trees would be valid
yes! aren't those interesting? great area of study
lol seriously?
the roosters where fighting this morning
I did when I was a kid :)
how can you chat and work at the same time?
Im really sick of this cube, how can I change?
where do I skip? Only option is check my work, proceed, and move on! but when I press move on it moves me on the the same damn cube
proceed?
holy cow, there is a massive circular cell in the middle of my cube. Looks like a death star. Maybe oligodendro or astrocyte? :|
This cube was already marked when I got it? How does that happen?
I wonder what the overall scores are now?
what?
Why hello there ninja dendrite
what kind of a scale is each cube at?
yeah, how large is each cube? in nanometers?
nanometers?
Ask Echo when he comes back on.
Did they happen to see it?
That's what I get for living by the big cities.
anyway to resume work if i accidently press escape?
how do I get a new cube? I keep getting the one I just finished
Zuckerburg should give us a medal when we win:p
?
I see what you mean
it updated that fast?
How high is it?
When they sober up a little, I'll tell them how they ruined science:p
yah for sure, one of the fun things about this is getting to color in other weird looking things around your cell to see what it is
bug where users in tutorial can't move on should be fixed
Now where's Grim?
hey all i just had to reload, someone mentioned a merger but i didn't have a chance to check it out, which team had the merger again?
thanks viper i'll see what i'll come up with 
how's that?
What?!? umm, wait, actually I don't think we have a merger.. have you guys seen a merger? I didn't see one.
How exactly was that blaxing a trail?
@dhill23  what team are you on
is qubit still listed as FB too?
that's neat :) is there a chime sound with it too? (kidding, it just seems appropriate)
that's why I am not a fan of trailblazing...I like keeping my accuracy up
how does that happen, exactly? at that magnitude?
is anybody else crashing?
anyone else having issues w/ the game right now?
Could anyone explain what trailblazing is.... I have an empty cube, what now?
and it's empty, right?
But I couldn't tell you why you have an empty cube...if it's a new one, you may need to refresh
ah...those punks ;) I saw that and wondered if that was why
I don't fully understand, I am afraid.  What am I actually doing, if the AI already has it figured out?
when you are out of the tutorial the AI hasn't figured it out yet
I'm brand new to this, so what do we do?
Yeah that's why I'm here ;P
Where do I find the tutorials? Wiki?
where are my points
i finish a nuron and no poits ???
Are you still in the tutorial?
how i now if i am in totoral?
could you imagine the smog cloud over THAT city?
ok that's an amazing fact....so your saying the US can house the entire population in one state?
how does this map the brain
How's the game loading?
is this a beta or final release?
@amy, do you know if elise from IFLS plays?
?teamfacebook
That would be cool -- Elise, are you here? haha
yeah you got on IFLS, it's how I got here!
ok, so i have the 3D model, but dont have the layered cube like in the tutorial. any help pls?? 
is echo here?
yep, was a bit surprised when *I* didn't have cubes avail
i sthere a way to shut the chat off?
@necoaraujo didn't you ever watch Bambi as a kid?  "If you can't say something nice, don't say nothin at all"  -- also don't swear in chat.
@awallis not currently. But I think if you start playing and don't click in chat it stops showing up?
If it were not too much trouble, it would be cool if Echo or whoever could make the chat stop autoscrolling when you want to scroll up to 
you guys consuming ethanol?
but amy would need a special thumping sound when she comes online
really? I had wondered about that actually
Out of curiosity, does the software try to orient the cubes so we are working down through the length of the neurons, or is it just as is?
what, denial of service miah?
When too many people try to go to one site at the same time and no one can get on.
that's what the scientists really said.. and someone (maybe media) shortened it I think
what smalljude said
@coolcat you mean like a time-progression video to watch once it 's done?
they know how to stir up controversy and thus ratings
now see what you've done??
is there any way to redo the tutorial?
599 points?  Wow!
hehe... what's the green team?
@amy --- When it tells you to 'search for missing pieces'... I guess I don't understand what exactly that means.
I can't get the stupid thing to undo... help?
it means youre looking to fill inside the lines -- when you color in it adds a missing "piece" of neuron
look at the ? mark on lower right for how to use mouse
how does one exit the tutorial?
how?
otherwise you will screw your team up and get a bunch of the cubes deleted, like what happened to reddit
what happened to reddit could happen to any of us though
how can i make slizes load faster??
what happened to reddit?
not sure what to look for even
HEY GUYS! how can i make slizes load faster??
what happened to reddit?
oh - do you think we are doing ok on the accuracy?
whats a merger?
when the AI picks more than one neuron
and Ketta, I think, was right when she said it could happen to anybody.. But your can minimize risk by finishing the tutorial 
How would you know when your trailblazing 
When you finish your cube, it will tell you that you just "trailblazed" 
how do i spot mergers?
mergers become easier to spot the more you play the game and start to get an idea of what shape the neurons usually take and the 
so what happens if we've all screwed up and the map we produce is completely wrong?
How can we see our accuracy though?
when some doctor goes to do neurosurgery or something
so what do you do when you get a cube where the neuron just dips in and out of the corner? Doesn't seem like there is anything to add.
@durandal wha?
just wanted to know what was going on here, exactly
when it says I've finished all the cubes in a cell, does that mean I'll have to switch to a team other than facebook?
i thought many of the same things when i started too
@dandune are you out of cubes?
so if I do those, would I be repeating ones I've already done?
what cell are you on dandune? it might be a glitch from all the new traffic
how long will this go on? until it's finished??
this week's games, or the entire project?
Were im I?
the ongoing games. so this week then?
how well does the average Brazilian speak english?
did you do the tutorials?
where do you get to the tutorial? I'm lost!
Wich team i'm I?
@kev715 did you declare allegiance on the blog post about the games?
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFRkS0haSVRjUDBON25SYW9JbnlhUlE6MQ#gid=0
so are we helping science at all?
how do you play?
If we are helping, then why can't MIT have a machine do this process at a rate faster then us?
we're picking up where their program isn't able to
So, is anyone else here a biology major?
have u guys chosen a team ?
am i the only one here with a liberal arts major? lol
Were will we have the feed-back of what we are doing right now? I'm very enthousiast about what is hapenning right now! :P
What is the best branch of science?
jelena: here's a link to some info for starting out, including how to declare which team you're on:
how did you choose an allegiance??
barnzini I'm a fan of biology/zoology, but it really depends on perspective :) I love me some critter studying, so that's what I do
Every field is useful, how bout that?
trailblazing = ?
After this tutorial...I have no idea what I'm doing...
wait...is green reddit?  
Helped my ass out in French when I took that in college
How do i switch to reddit?  i thought i did that :(
If I choose one team right now, will I have the possibility to change if I want after ?
it's based on how you found eyewire
IFLS, thats how
And green is no team?
@getadelt have you done the tutorial?
Como estas?
what if there was a 4chan team...
but what if it's wrong????  lol
@getadelt what is the problem?
So how the heck am I supposed to turn my name blue? I already selected the FB cell.
@getadelt when you press "check my work" after the tutorials it will tell you if it's right or wrong
i know what it is
Is there only 1 Chat on ALL eyewire??
I mean, of course there should be some team chats but is this one the general chat?
We gonna have a problem ( in one point it's gonna be a good thing) when this game will become really mainstream! :P
when does this game close?
Seriously?! :(
how can I stop the annoying chat soundd
wow, you had to uncaps the F?
The competition but hopely not the game ??
?
wait so this game only runs until wednesday? :( and then it's over?
now?
I'm still in the tutorial but the instructions and the chat are not only distracting but are covering up the 3D cube.  Can I turn it off?
C57bl6?
She does?
I can't get over how cool this really is
so, do some cubes just yield really low points or am I just sucky at this?
dumb question is this a real expeiment mit is doin or is this just a game ?
Who came here from IFLS?
they should do this with telescopes not sure how but that woul be amazing lol
I came from IFLS, but I can't figure out how to change my name to blue. I'm on the FB cell.
but only 20 were added?
I would join team facebook for IFLS but reddit is where my heart is :)
why do I keep getting 19s and 20s? :(
when I seem to randomly get 300s
so if these cubes are now unknowns, how does it know what is right?
You are in the tutorial if it tell you what is right
how can it check my work if these are new cubes
when does the tutorial end then?
and how do you know?
how is this like enders game�
LOL drnemmo! I never thought if that way, what could we be DOING REALLY?
After you do really well i think. and I know becuase I  just left it when I thought i did a while ago
what if the real test isnt mapping neurons, but seeing how much time well waste colouring in subjective borders?
What if we are tracking connections between terrorist groups and we are actually working for the CIA? 
did anyone bother to check to make sure this site is legitimate?
fun when you high
i wonder how itll take to get eyewire on tbbt
they ARE called cells, how do we know they arent terrorist cells?
i see what you did there
what determins how I score?
but based on what, if it's all new?
@durandal scoring is based on how you compare to what other players have done in the same cube and volume, and a little bit on time
what will the neuron be named?
do you still earn points in the tutorial?
because a girl on here hated when they would say the word "moist:
how long does it take for you guys to explore a branch?
depends how long it is
Pardon me fellas, but I'm ready to map the hell outta some neurons n shit but I'm thinkin I'll need a tutorial. Reckon ya'll could help?
what about drinking WHILE mapping neurons?
@getadelt ... don't know where that is...
lets pick up the pace slackers...we are behind facebook...seriously?
so what is the competition structure?  A neuron every week or something?
what's the time where you are at?
aldo667  what the hell?
@eyethethird, where you from?
Wait, if someone were to mess this up on purpose, could that mess up science? 
@durand this is our first beta -- we weren't sure how it would go -- not sure how they will go in the future
you?
10:34 here as well...what are we doing with our saturday nights?
^^^what she said
who is this amylee?
did I seriously just read that question?
so you're the folks that created this?
good stuff.  i know what i'll be doing every night off work now.
well I didn't really build it -- when @echo gets here, sing him praise. The guys have done an amazing job
what do use for the rendering?  Voxels?
you have any use for a designer? :D
good GAWD how can a 5lb dog produce a smell like this?
Where did that come from?
fill this out and tell us why yo play http://bit.ly/featuredeyewirer
this was an extremely hard one.. I thought I kinda had this figured out, but suddenly I have no idea what I'm doing
is this helping science or something?
such as how we perceive motion
invaluable, actually. our lab could never do what the eyewire communtiy does. it's amazing
all well and good Amy but what about the children, we play for the children.
I hate it when I can't seem to gain proficieny in something a monkey could be trained to do but I have been approved to move on.
i wish you could redo the same cube and do different things to see what worked better. I feel like i'm not learning from my mistakes.
it's so nice when you hit that 1px sweet spot and almost the whole thing appear :D
If you could bring any dead scientist back to life, who would it be? Discuss.
to see how it looks with the rest of the neuron
Darwin did what he needed to do, but ya, Tesla needs to tell use how to make wireless energy
didnt tesla say knowledge could be transferred through energy?
is it possible to change the angle of the cross section?  What do I do too view horizontal cross setions insted of vertical
?
Could brain waves be transferable?
fascinated or disappointed?
oh good one Amy (why do I never think of him first?)
If energy could be wireless... then, couldn't electic neurolagical waves?
@ketta who was ypurs? can't scroll..
what morals or philosophies would they be fascinated with?
so what am i looking at here, a brain scan?
how do we turn the chat off 
agreed. thats why i think they would say wow......all this time and this is all that you've done
does anyone else admire the romans? i think they set an example
why am i only getting trailblazer
he saw that when the persecuted Socrates
that's why the US doesn't have a complete democracy. There are checks and balances
what's wrong with republicans :3
Are we supposed to fix what we missed before moving on?
are we confusing any non 'Murican users?
Unfortunately, even us non-Muricans know what you're talking about there :\nakrambler  WFT?  Are you really going to talk about what we are actually supposed to be doing here? :-)
Do you guys watch Stewart and Colbert?
I don'get that one.  The first car was made of hemp???????
it's really sad how hemp is so regulated, when it's useful for so much
It's sad how weed is so illegal when it's useful for so much :D
Exactly why I didn't want to read it
Do you guys read Scientific American? 
moving on...about the metorite hitting russia, is the end near?
eh depends what you mean when you say near...
what color is team X
?
i heard putin tell the russian people that he knows when the world is going to end
What am I?
I signed up for team X but I'm still green?
what that one said
?
what is green?
/teamx is this working?
WHOA, now I'm actually mapping for real?
@rosebello what team do you want to join?
what?!
team x. Maybe  have to finish the test ones first?
Why is everyone names different clours D:
perhaps you mean droll?
@rosebello, are you on tutorial?
money grubbing whores? absolutely
it just started me on a half attempted one? Oo
is this a sausagefest if we don't count amy?
country when I first got there  but over the years I grew to love the place.  I miss it
i dont get why sausagefest is deragatory
are they not delicious?
deragatory? what does that mean?
oh for goodness sakes amy - this is why I asked to be able to turn off chat
eyethethird, where are you from?
is echo on yet?
how do I change to team X
how do you hide chat?
wow really?
hrss is echo on?
isnt sweden highly religious?
what's echo?
amy hows it goin?
Anyone here from Norway?
tres bien, and you?
Why can't Norway operate with the EU?
did anyone else disable their sticky keys option too?
Anyone here play league of legends?
That pretty much defines distraction: When one's attention is pulled away from what one should be attending to, to something else.
does anyone program? if so, with what language?
how about you jacob?
hrss, what microprocessors have you used assembly with?
there's no sense using assembly when you can use c++ instead
What do you use for a pic programmer?  Microchip stuff or can I get away with diy or cheap ebay crap?
of how a processor works
starburst neuron?
wtf it doesnt matter what i do i get trailblazer
how can you see that  - the type of cubes someone gets
yes, but how are you seeing how many trailblazes someone has
They keep track of that?
what does that mean?
anybody know where I should report a merge?
There is a contact us in the ? on the right
how to map branez? 
merge?
?
merge is an error where two cells merge together
any simple tips or a how to antwhere?
how do you get rid of this chat bit, it's a pain in the arse
spread the word if anyone asks how to disable, no documentation for it yet
how do I mute this?
seriously - what the hell am I doing right now? 
how do you remove chat window....
what is this site
what happens if you horribly mess up a cube and you didnt know?
@the new folks...if you want to learn how to play, click start playing in the upper right corner and it will take you to the tutorial
how would you screw up a cube? 
I am so confused as to what I am doing right now 
@cony have you done the tutorial yet?
what is the purpose of this site
I just don't get what I am accomplishing here 
it does get easier with the more you do correct? 
chat sounds are gone?
ketta, which group are you part of?
neurons from where?
@cony just do what you were doing in the tutorial...is there any point in going back and adding what you have missed after you click the "check work" button?
@ketta, are you part of the FB team?
so scientists have utilized the masses to do their work? 
how do you initiate the cube?
hey how can i pick my team?
Who's winning right now?
may someone answer my question please?
what is is?
it?
@ketta, do you know about merges?
does mapping get easier with the more you do?
You get used to it and can tell what goes where
cant someone just write software to do this?
thats what the AI is
Lol that's what we're doing kinda
...why miklanios? 
with?
i dont understand how to do this?
are you in the tutorials?
so this is what I'm doing on a Saturday night 
how it is multiplayer thing
@bhavin have you done the tutorials yet?
@ketta, do you know about merges?
they are errors when players start tracing the wrong thing and it continues into a wrong area
how does it know if something is correct
do you know where the discussion about it is? 
well @andrewb you may want to look at it and contribute what you're thinking
I'm no expert, but it doesn't look right. I'll see what I can find.
What does trailblaze mean?
let some others catch up to where you are so trailblazing spreads out
I'm not going to argue, I'm just telling you how it is..from someone who's been playing a while.
really?
Who all is on?
aye eudanil, sometimes those are not part of what you're working on...it can go through a hole
i am lagging big time, any of you?
no lamby i'm ok, but when i get like that i just relog
the truth is miklanios has got a lot of points by doing what he's doing
that's what I'm talking about!
it's a smart way to get points, and with a scoring system that sometimes suck, i can empathize with why it's tempting
hrss, is it possible that my cube is a dud?
What is a trailblazer?
another one Milklanois?
is there any way to hide all of these fucking garbage chat windows?
who?
/?
i dont see what it clutters unless youre playing on a 8" screen
it's annoying when it's just 3-4 people endlessly bitching about each other
I want to be able to scroll through the neurons quickly to see how they move, the more shit is on my screen the slower it scrolls
oh, aren't you pleasant? :)
right?
what a nice person
how to turn off chat?
what is this 'trailblazed a cube'?
how close were the points?
what miklanios said lol
few hundred..i think?
you guys were within 3 points?!
Can people do coop on a cube?
your score is based on how others have done a cube, the size of the neuron piece, and a little bit on time spent on it
I'm new, when do I start getting points?
@mik yeah...that's why when i get to trailblazing, I either stop for a while and come back...
how are the points added up?
@tray you get points based on how well your work compares to others who've done the cube, volume, and a little bit on tiem spent.
What does the colors of nicknames?
I hate it when I bloody well get 99what a terrible fucking layout this website has
once your done with tutorial, your gonna miss when it used to tell you how you did
that's how the one i had right before midnight was, started out as a wee nubbin.. i had all kinds of stuff to fill in, branches everywhere
but when I do... *facepalm*
what does it mean?
when you get 20 points
really? cause this one was pretty straightforward.. i just clicked on obvious spot and it filled out the rest for me
I bet that's what happened!
what the hell is this, a tiny nub in the bottom corner?
why?
but after you mentioned it, that's when i began to consider that i might be screwing it up by doing that
yeah, that's why I speak up. I try to be as diplomatic as possible :P
I'm also writing up an email to echo/amy about trying to change how trailblazing works
what is trailblazing?
I'm out of tutorial now. Do you just click what you think is right and then "check my work" ?
if it still says "check my work" then you must still be on a tutorial i think?
so what study am i helping by doing thisi?
you live near south america?
do you have a friend named wilson?
with who?
a merger?
merger?
when cells are connected where they arent supposed to be
did you see that branch coming on from way out there to one side?
hold shift while scanning up and down while keeping an eye on what you know is supposed to be filled in, works for me
afternoon? it's midnight l0l
am I the only one who wishes this competition had commentators? hehehe
what's the reward for winning
well I do love the memes.... and btw how will the team decide on the name anyhow?
is there a way to preload the entire cube?
lo don't you know Jacob? it is Jeff Brdiges!...dont listen to me i am just crazy
jed, click the little gear under the 2d image, what are your bandwidth/latency settings?
change latency to high, that might make them preload more (maybe?)
Puta?
Heuvos? Why?
Because penis, that's why
And it's not the length of the vector that counts. It's how you apply the force ;)
That's what she said
i dont understand how this shiz works
yes magic and unicorns!.... that's how babies are made and space flight works too
awww are you still trying to find your X daniel?
ahhhhhh I get it ;D. I see what you did there :)
"So daniel, what did you do today?" Oh nothing, just mapped out the FUCKING BRAIN.
or in an interview, "what type of things do you like to do on your spare time?"  - Neuroscience.
So what makes you qualified to work at here at Barns and Noble? I do neuroscience.
What the fuck do you do?
why  would you apply at B&N?
So when do we get paid?
when I look at some of these slides I feel like this brain was made for super nintendo with how pixelated it looks
anyone else high while doing this?
does zopiclone count?
How noble
Milklanios I thought you were going to bed?
You know what would make this even better?
Has anyone here every tried a gravity bong?
I want to know how to trailblaze a cube
that's what I want to fucking know
what does it mean when you've trailblazed it?
and you get 50 points for it no matter what you do
thats what they should have done, put us into districts
Everything is jumpy what the fuck hahaha
Can you see the bald spot?
why do some people have different colors?
and how do you kno which color is which
hmm and whats the point to teams?
did it work now?
red is for reddit, blue is facebook, i think gold is google maybe? or veterans?
vets? which team is that?
Are you saying that you liked this thing before it was cool?
don't feed any potential hipsters danny with your talk of 'before it was cool'.... we've all seen where that road takes people on youtube
i always wonder what trend the people who pretend to hate trends will follow next
what???
is there a way to paint in different colors?
what
haha especially when they're making strange
where r u from 
?
italy. u?
still in uni?
tomorow ?
where r u from ?
which uni?
angus22? where does the semester start in feb?
queensland?
?
whers that then ?
where can i change the country where im from? or do they track your ip for that?
am I the only one who is quite often getting cubes with very little to modify?
I just had one where I didn't find anything to modify at all.
does it say that you " trailblazed" as well?
what is the trailblaze
? 
is it AI or just image processing?
when you're blazing a trail. srsly, don't know
the projected size?
but i'm not sure how to describe why it's so addictive
/?
yeah... should have realised it when I didnt hear the chat beep for some time
is there way to turn down chat sounds?
how do you get to trailblaze a cube?
when you finish the tutorial 
What is it Trailblazing does?
How are points caluculated? My best@100my 3D cube became small.......what can I do?
silver??
when u see the whole map there are some greyyish big balls
no one?
is the last tutorialneuron really that huge?
what if you find another that is not attached
shall i pick that one too?
my restart button doesn't work!?
does the "restart this cube" function normally work?
is there any way to rotate (3D) the slice plane?
click and drop?
?
21 points? LOL, this was bad.
I keep getting the same group of cubes, already completed (by me or someone else ?)... Is this normal ?
Well I don't know what the hell to make of this cube....
Is that because the current cell is mostly done ?
how do you get 1000 points
HOW I ASK YOU?!
hate when that happens!
When I hit shift, it honestly looks like the AI put patches of blue where I only see a sea of noise
so this is put on my Massachusetts tech eh?
I hate it when tree sperm is in the air
is there a possibility to correct the AI? it added another branch right in the first place
have any of you run into squares where AI had it all pretty much correct?
such a big and ugly thing and only 360 points?
And what if there is a little blob on the side and nothing else (round surface) - happens way too often
so why's everyone else doing this? What's driving you to complete these things?
Science, possibility of naming a neuron I heard? 
Lol, I don't know what alt drag's supposed to do, but when I do it, I move the whole window...
7What's motivating me?  Boredom.  At least this way I feel like I'm accomplishing SOMETHING
I'd name it after something that shows how everyone is working together... or IFLS... one of the two
how/when are you able to name a neuron?
how do i turn the chat off  the noise is driving me nuts!!!
dirty mind right?
So how do you know when its a real neuron and not training? And how do they know if were getting any of this right??
When they can't tell you if its correct or not
on the training ones, they let you see how you did. on the real ones, you don't know
How many points you guys got? 
seriously how can u guys work with that message noise ?
Is there any way to select a cube that's not already been done ??
As far as I know, there's only the chat sound in this game... ?
but no idea how to turn just chat sounds off
you'll name it AI?
Which would explain why all cubes are already complete in all cells BUT the Facebook cell... Which has only 2 cubes left.
What am I doing? :P
yeah cheers, but how is this game meant to be played?
Interesting.  I have what appears to be two neurons crossing in an x shape, with a bridge between them.
didn't it say something about x shapes in the tutorial?
yeah it did but i forgot what it said lol\nit's easy to see why computer would have trouble doing this. so much is judgement
I'm tired of this. 90how is the score calculated?
so are these all retinal neurons? 
's why it's called Eyewire
so most of what you found wasn't the neuron they wanted
did any of my previous messages show up? i disconnected
oh, i was wondering how they check if what you did is correct if its all supposed to be new
let's see what i got so far
does anyone know?
does anyone else have to load this frame by frame?
nobody?
jelligeth > What is it you ask ?
Why .. why are there pieces black on the overview?
can you get -points lol?
I don't get it.. How can the software tell me I've missed some parts if the connections are not yet known?
How do I change my country? It's showing some strange flag
Do I score points in the tutorial?
I've done about 10 cubes so I should be out of the tutorial by now?
JInseop spent all night going through the cubes and found a LOT of mergers -- that's why the teams have dropped so much. 
Do you have three buttons in the bottom mof the screen - one red, one yellow, one green ?
you'll know if you don't get any feedback when you say you've finished
wish I could use multiple colours for branches where I'm unsure...
if we are answering something that 'they' dont know, how is it that we can check our work? lol
guys, how many days has this site been on?
borednerdy > Plus when you're out of the tutorials, since we're a lot of people tracing the same neurons, the program can use that input.
Over a year or something? Don't know.
hmmm @wtc some of the things that are blacked out do not look like mergers. I'm not sure what's going on
This is how the AI can figure out the "correct" answer whereas it didn't know it from the start.
Maybe they are currently discontinued because they are no longer interesting .. and they are planning to move them to completed?
@amy Any chance on implementing multiple colours? E.g. as a reminder which branches one has already verified, or which ones one is uncertain
@zomm in the future, right now that is actually a very challng addition -- we've discussed it intensely, and I'm not sure why but something 
is there a way to view the cell we are working on?
I'm not sure what's going on right now.
milboss > can't you see it whole in the overview ?
how do you get back to overview :P
Amy do you work with Eyewire?
what does it mean that I'm the "trailblazer"?? XD
Am I the only brit here? :D
only 12/7 right? gotta eat and sleep don't we?
so how do they check the work? anyone know?
but why can't they use algorithms to do the work in the first place
they look normal?
what smoking pot has to do w/ the shape of my neurons, i may never know
oh come now Jeer, we're not mindless slugs when we smoke weed. 
@alexjeer recent studies suggest that you mess up your brain, memory etc when you smoke regularly, but that it goes back to normal a while
i don't understand, they have to check if it's correct, how do they know its correct if they can't just do it?
some people become very lucid when smoking pot
have you been reading science journals? :D
Did you know that too much reading can give paper cuts? :O 
@jelli and can't scroll to what you said either, since the chat goes to the bottom as soon as someone writes or finishes a cube -_-
seems kinda unreliable. What if people are doing it all wrong
Several people map the same cube -- we compare how they trace it to get a validation of sorts
right, what pezito said
@Amy whose neurones are we looking at?
also @amy do all neurones look the same in everyone? :o
so are you yellow people mods/creators?
So how does the cube math work.  Current Size = 20, Growth in 24 = 307, Available = 2
is this still the tutorial?
how do i know when im no longer tutorializing?
bran, you won't get any feedback when finishing the cube
Did you hear about the mice that were given infrared vision?
how many cubes does that take
@amyleerobinson so is this the progress that you've been looking for?
so are we basically training your AI?
and at some point that your AI will be more trained will go through the 'wires' we have completed to get refined results?
Amylee, what's your job on this project?
i think IFLS mentioned this a few months ago too, when Eyewire wasn't competitive yet
which is why i got here
@amyleerobinson have you spoken with the peeps at IFLS?
@amy At a later stage, you could consider a co-op mode, where multiple persons can discus the same section of a cube
ugh how long is tutorial lol
@zommuter yes, we're trying to figure out how to add more team-based colaboration
so, your AI, based on image processing how is it trained not to think a mistake as a valid slice of neuron?
what is trailblazing?
@tsioutsi we train the AI on how people trace -- that's why accuracy is so important. 
jed: when you're the first to trace a cell through a cube
how do you acquire the images /?
@amy does the AI only evaluate sequential cross-sections or does it consider a complete small 3D surrounding?
or it creates it this is why when u paint an area it turns into a 3d object 
@pinky how do i do that?
?
and how's the bandwidth set?
@zommuter: sure! but what we build the 3d
anybody know exactly how big each square is?
can i turn sound off?
ok I accidentally moved my 2d on it's axis... how do I do it again? lol
Ah .. that's what you mean ...
i think I now got what u whwre saying
Anyway, I think what restricts us is the bandwith of their servers and their proccessing power
Doesn't WebGL use your local processing power?
what do u guys talk about here
so what exactly is the trailblazer? 
boom: when you're the first to trace a neuron in a cube
how do you know its a trailblazer?
yeah how do you know?
you'll know when you've finished the cube
how do you earn 1000 points in one go?
why is something "incorrect" when i think it is not
anyone here heard of Eugene the AI chatterbot?
what does the green bar in the overview mean?
in the overview it's how much of the cell you're working on has been traced
sorry for what?
jelli where do you live?
for running fast?
how hot it is? I am too xO
ok, remember the part in tutorial that said th AI does mistakes? should I just finish the cube when I think thats the case ?
do people continue other peoples trace or they start from the one th AI first created? 
?
??
correct ?
224 points for skipping?
how am i supposed to contribute with something new if this game can judge when i'm right and when i'm wrong?
the A.I. knows it all already?
if this game tell me when i'm wrong, then he knows the right answer.
have u finished tutorial ?
are you still in the tutorial?
however that would explain why u sometimes have a lot to do and sometimes nearly nothing to do
how come so few points :<
Dinner? it is morning here!
Is there a possibility to see contents of the adjacent cubes? 
Is there a place to view the leaderboard? I don't see it on the homepage.
how do you earn points? Mine still says 0
how do I get out of that?
is that green colour team facebook? 
what team r u josh?
how do i trailblaze a cube?
@asd are you out of tasks?
out of cubes I men?
Is anyone out of available cubes?
how do you find out if you have tasks?
My current cube has a lot of bad areas marked by AI. How can I mark it for review?
anyone here?
so ya, has anyone been getting cubes with random AI artifaacts that dont connect to anything?
im new here. you guys are doing a competition between teams?:D
What does trailblazed mean ? 
trailblazing is when you've finished a cube for the first time
how it is determined to which team you join? I was automatically in reddits team
IRC? wow, true tech nerd here!
what is team "x"?
which server are they on?
what is dead may never die
when the wolves come out of the walls
so, does anyone get sent back to the same cube when they say "skip cube"?
how come I get lik 40 points for each cube?
hmmm there seems to be a lot of "trailblazing" going on. is there a server problem?
what color is what team?
can blue mean google+ by chance?
ok, my name is green and it says i'm in reddit team?
hi! so why we are in teams?
@echo you're a developer, right?
why would u want to be in Fb team anyway?
developer for the research team? 
@echo Great job! Do you consider implementing multiple colours?
you wrote this whole thing?
@echo: 1st, u get these images from where? 
wow I'm beyond impressed! can't wait to learn more. where I can go to read up on this? I was sent here by IFLS
@echo: u wrote the image proccessing soft?
u did the platform ?
here?
are you a graduate student yourself?
paying back any karma?
ok, as Massachusetts tech I assume? that's where my peerblocker says you'r pinging me from lol 
My guess is that it depends on how much you id, and this depends on how good the AI was in that cube
is this going to run for a long time?
?
any android apps?
sick amount of trailblazing at the moment?
trailblazing only gets me 50pts, how do I get more!
What team is the green team>
Test what?
:the collouring on the webpage is based on the grad code correct ?
and u "report' the results back to them ?
correct >?
!!! what is programming with no bugs!!
perfection?
Seems like new stuff got added? :)
@echo what's up with all the blackness?
recently fixed it, but it will take a couple hours to fully rectify what it did
That's what happens when you let computers control things ... :)
@echo, so best to just keep mapping?
what did it do? (layman's version lol)
would that have cause random AI spots that didn't connect to anything?
were you the one who emailed me?
I haven't emailed you. It was beasically a few AI "balls" of pre-written paths that didn't connect to anything when I tried to trance them.
What language is the server backend written in?
You know what sounds like a weird bug? The DUNG BEETLE.
@echo why there is admin tools showing in user settings?
hmm, I just skipped a cube and its brought up a pop up telling me I am the trailblazer, a bug possibly?
Is there a way to see the teams leaderboard?
what does trailblazing again mean?
ok, i now trailblazed about 6 cubes in a row, is that good?
will we still be able to participate after the challenge?
hiw can I be so bad at this?
?
screen grab?
so is the point system explained anywhere?
showing you where you and the consensus disagreed
does the AI see the thing in cubes? or cubes is just for the site?
Who is the Al? ... 
hal over 9000?
Are there cubes where there is nothing to find ? 
what is with all this trailblazing
My trailblazing only get passed to team X, right?
so are you the guy in the video echo?
and what video
How does it know what @echo: When a new cell is opened, we see ea black figure of a cell. this i a figure reasoned by the AI correct?
that's what the cube generator massively messed up this morning
u mean?
What happened this morning?
?
this is what I was asking in the first place 
ok so we don't have to start all over?
@echo Do you also evaluate "wrong" branches?
how do you mean?
do you have a way to remove all work done by one user? just in case u get trolls or griefers on here?
I mean if branches are crossing and I traced another one by accident, is that tracking still useful for the AI?
ok good! I was wondering how you'd do that
ya, there have been a couple times where two paths mix so close that I know it's different but can't find the separation point
@echo: howabout a report button for AI mistrakes ?
echo have you or someone else looked at the long piece (it's pretty obvious) in the FB cell?
@echo didn't realize I had been before, so what am I able to do?
Can we mute you?
also, is there supposed to be music/sounds? I'm not getting any and the speaker icon doesn't do anything
Viper found a problem the other day when he muted himself and couldn't go back and unmute
Whats the highest ranking color mod?
how do i disable sound
how do I enable sound? lol!
not sure why you don't have sound robel..
really?
Anyone know what team @phdfluff is on? 
nope, but he's swedish, right?
google+ I thought was his affiliation, why?
o so dhill is team x?
I'll just list it as a "?" mystery player :)
ooo 34 in the world? feels pretty awesome!
what is team x? 
So, whats the future of this game once the neuron has been mapped?
lol! so unaffiliated then? 
does that turn off the noise in chat, or chat itself?
i don't understand this... am i supposed to color based on the left image?
the left image is a rendering of what you've colord on the 2D image on the right
@adrielo are you still in the tutorial or are you tracing 'for real' now?
and yeah, what robel said..your 2D (the right) represents the 3D (the left)
how many practice cubes are there?
oh, so I have to paint based on what I see in the right image
@wtc, are you offering to do all the trailblazing? :)
yep, and the 2D will give you clues on what you see in the 3D also
if you look at the 3D side, the grey 'slice' shows where you are in the cube
I'm waiting for superpowers where I can say 'this cube needs revisiting'
from 10x40p to 1000p, what a suprise
had no idea what I was doing though
is there a way to revisit the tutorial stage? after completion it said something about me now being an expert... somehow I really don't feel
do u guys know how many unique users you've had?
when it says, so and so earned 200 points, is that for 1 cube?
why am i green?
did you declare your team?
31k? dang. I REALLY hope this takes off. social media doince SCIENCE! amazing
^like that?
welcome to Team facebook! Did IFLS send ya here?
What was the reason for the big spike yesterday?
Did they post again?
is all af team facebook of ifls?
I don't like him either, but what he's done has been huge. I can dislike someone and still use their tools :P
where IFLS goes, i go
and there you go, that's why I'm on the blue team too..IFLS :D
and wonders what ifls stands for
why not a 9gag team?
whats reddit?
when they crashed us again yesterday, we were joking perhaps a good name would be 'IFLS-CRASH' for the neuron :P
@s3nyr have you really never heard of reddit?
curious, did anyone else hear about eyewire in a bar? (very geeky bar I guess)
any tips?
Does anyone know if Facebook holds a sizable lead?
I cant wait to hear the news when they tell the world that there's a computer that can do this in a few minutes
you dont get points for trailblazing, right?
Amy, y'all are planning on holding more competitions in the future right?
why i'm getting so low points?
evening anyone?
what up west coast
where ya from wtc?
what time is there ?
and where s there? 
how embarassing. How did I go from 100anyone in university?
where at?
Wilkes University... John Wilkes Booth.. Conspiracy?
how am i supposed to keep up
so what exactly is the point of this? is it just a game or are we helping somethin gout or what? xD
is t?
Why a mouse retnia?
easier to test on?
oooo a big cube here! 1000 here i come? 
you should read about the research and about what this is about
Does this actually piss off wbc?
you must see that your group is bad when even the KKK counter-protest you...
i was on a tobacco research where they use mice to test the effects of tobacco smoke
what was the result?
what if this whole thing is a farce? and like
What about marijuana smoke?
@adelso nicotine affects the brain doesn't it?
AA? 
what against creative arts? O.o
illegal substances out of chat? :) 
you can talk about them, but don't talk about doing them. how about that 
S.W.I.M. sorta?
Drugs are bad, Mkay?
Does yellow mean like your Staff?
Who goes to MIT?
who here is form murica?
how'd u get 282 adelso? lol
here is a taste of what you'll get :P
http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=424847294256330&set=a.416542215086838.94433.249261865148208&type=1&theater
DR?
what's carnival though O.o
where you able to see the picture
this carnival open to anyone? lol
how are the carnivale in aruba like?
i must have missed it in the tutorial, but what are we helping to do here?
right? 
what does trailblaze mean?
do you have to follow the dark blue one in each cube youre given?
I have a slice with a scratch/hair/impurity, any way to flag it?
what is the point with this?
aka, help save the world? idk haha
who is 1st?
Yeah who would? lol
how do you trailblaze? 
how exactly does playing this game help the scientists map the brain?
it helps the AI learn how to do it
how to do it better!
they made me stop because their heads were exploding when they realised the actual size of one of these cells
is there always something to do in each square?
So daniel, what did you do today? Oh not much, just some neuroscience. 
Who needs girls or a life when you can be mapping out Mouse Retinas?!
what are girls?
!! waht is life?
Who here goes to MIT?
use to go?@amy
What did you major in?
Can somebody tell me what a transposon is?
how do u apply?!?!?
710 points?! jeez
no engineers with experience in power plants?!?!?
what determines the amount of points you get for a cube?
@tom points are determined by time and accuracy based on how other mapped the same cube.
what is to tra?ilblae cube
when you do it as a trial to measure your accuracy
and?
trailblazing is when you go through a cube first
89 accuracy is dat good compare 2 other ?
...I'm getting 50 points each time no matter what It just told me that I was the trail blazer. What does this mean?
When are we getting paid? :)
What, that's not true haha
holy shit, is it?
Yes, problem?
When I come visit SF I'll buy the coffee :)
you're at 500K @hrss?
how do you shut off the chat?
do you mean the sounds?
Where do you get off?
no, how do you hide it completely
I can come too? :)
@reb yea!  you're in SF yea?
You wanna die? Just wear the wrong color rag. :)
Amy are you doing some sort of travelling eye wire tour? haha
never been to Yosemite. TED..I LOVE TED.  Where's the coolest place you guys have traveled?
well, I haven't been many places...but I loved visiting the redwoods in northern CA and yellowstone when I was a kid
EWWWW Did you know that there are blue people living in Kentucky?
Does this convo box slow down the the areas you color cause its lagging on me. If it is doing that how do I get rid of this thing?
that's what I was about to say :D
Pinky, did you do it? haha
noob question. how do u get more then 50 points?
Does it get easier? At the moment, I feel like I'm fumbling around
@efire and jlovin did you do the tutorials?
get it brony?
once you don't get feedback on what percentage you get right, you'll get more than 50 points
who's ahead, fb or reddit?
ahead by how many?
what is this
Amy's going to sleep for a week when this is done :P
@amy. when the competition is over, the eyewire will continue to be up. right???
whynot?
We're brainstorming now how to do future competitions.
Mobile app? Yea we've been trying to hire someone to do that
Why do I feel that might be duplicate work?
Why is it that half of the cube is all squares now?
@amy, which team are you on?
@I'm not actually on a team. Mostly just checking random cubes to see how people are faring
40... which makes you a veteran ... doesn't it? :)
why is there so much lag?
who has been doing the starburst cell in the beginning?
allright. so it was you guys from the HQ? What are you gonna do about them then?
@amy What's the actual dimension of a cube (in SI units please)?
microns is 10^(-6) m?
are we just fixing computer errors?
computer finds connections to the best of the AI ability, we find what it missed
how large is each cube?
where does eyewire get the samples
is no where close to 5.9 mm
aren't microns .001 mm?
so wait where did the 23 microns come from
how do the points work?
you're past the tutorials when there's 3 buttons under the playing fiels
once you're out of the tutorial, they're based on how your work compares to others who ha ve worked on the same cube...
I'm confused. One cube is 5mm wide? Doesn't that mean, that the whoe structure that is being worked on is pretty huge, as there are heaps of
cubes? 
exactly why it's so hard to map a complete neuron
where are the dendrites/axons/nuclei?
I thought we're talking about a mouse's brain, wtf?
but isn't that even smaller? o_O
wouldnt we actually be doing both the axons ANDthe dendrites?
 z direction is where the tissue was cut. 

256x16 = 4.1 um (micro meter)
256x22 = 5.6 um
so one is 5,6 um wide?
make more sense to map the same one wouldn't it?
so this is the eye, not the brain?
puts things into perspective doesn't it?
what are the black ones?
It's a little surprising how often we have this question..
the whole "what is this about"..
but were not touching the optic nerve are we?
just sensory neurons in the eye?
retina of mouse?
right?
so completely seperate neurons that only relay info to the brain, but are not in any way located in the brain?
You guys are all way past me...could you explain to me what all of this filling in the gaps is? I am on the tutorial, you see.
@yzazu Out of curiosity how did you end up here?
@yzazu your school sent you to eyewire.org?
I like it more for its challenge than what it does scientifically, if any, at that.
What is the youngest eyewirer? :)
who is the oldest? haha
or i there an 8 yr old?
Reminds me of me when I was 9, ... was probably playing Quake2 or something at this time.
i think it depend on where you live, im 17 but i dont live in the states so my generation doesn't suck that much
105???
is there any way to make the chat sound shut up or hide the chat window?????
is anyone using firefox?
oh wow now there are starburts?
are these really somebody's brain maps?
"hey guys guess which country america is raping now?"
(you're dutch right wtc?)
like how I do the starburst better than all of the linear ones
So, who's heard of IBO?
whatthecode, just curious, how did you like the netherlands?
Which city?
The U.S. is starting on what looks like a pretty strong comeback
TIL what yonic means. haha
so, inny instead of outy?
how rude!
Is there an efficient way to reload when the full plane doesn't show up? I keep getting a checkerboard in the lower left quadrant.
I went back and restarted and fixed that issue when I had it
still don't understand what "trailblazed a cube" means :/
the first to complete the missing pieces?
I dont know why but every time I earn points it doesnt seem to add onto my points I already have :S
how complicated is a cube that rewards 1k?
how do you get to the more complex cubes?
i dont get the point in this?
what is the point of this?
yeah?
and how they connect
but it tells you when you're wrong?
It tells you when you are DEFFINATELY wrong
anyone know what size cross sections wer are working with?
i just didnt get the whole thing about how it knows you've missed stuff
so if it still tells me what i got wrong at the end, i'm in the tutorial, right?
so it compares ours to what others found?
when 1000 people do the same cube, where they agree (statistically) you can be pretty sure they are right.
how do you earn more point then 50?
i hate when the checkerboard appears
why is this so fun?
do we have to get a team? or can we just stay "green" (without team) ?
oh, I can even make an annoying cheerleader... *or when an otherwise busy chat goes silent for an uncomfortable amount of time :P
ohhh man, How do we report a bug??
what happened?
can't figure out where that bug is coming from
can you zoom in the 2D??
is it just me or is the server under high load again?
are we actually generating live data or just giving more data points for the AI algorithm? 
I just joined yesterday......when was this game launched??
what kind of meetup?
for TedX Redmond? 
but i thought they didn't have red on these?
when i reloaded it was ok 
but did it loged you out?
i'm confused because i still have the "check my work" button, and it tells me what's correct, incorrect, and missing on the 3D screen
how many more of these do i have to do before i'm out of tutorial?
in the tut o.o ?
anyone else from michigan by chance?
lol french ?
french what?
anyone from Alabama perchance?
ahha noo anyone from france? :S 
Does anybody here reside in the area known as the Louisiana purchase?
woaw! for work?
what are you studying?
aero?
erasmus or what?
but why france ?
 ahah so you speak french? 
bac S?
good for you! :) and you're from?
damn, why would you want to learn french 
now now, don't u have a neuron to map? "{
needs to be?
LV2?
si!! but I had italian in LV3 and spent 6months in italy, so now when i wanna speak spanish, only italian is come out of my mouth :P
Is the Reaper about?
is it true that germans shout all of their words they say?
i learned a good bit of dutch when i lived in the netherlands
Any admin guys around?
need echo??
rammstein?
?
Are you into steampunk or cosplay emmeline?
Echo?
?!! wtf 
hey echo...we all seem to analyze these cubes "vertically" do the cross checks have others doing it on another axis?
what are the changes again?
but my question is, the person who comes after him and does that cube, and they DO fill it in, do they get dinged on their points?
I keep getting almost nothing but trailblazers, is that because I am accurate that the algorithm wants me to be statistically relevant? 
what d3d support does IE have?
I can pretty much tell when I am trailblazing from the 3d as I am entering the cube, and then find lots of differences.
can you explain me what is trailblazing exactly
how do you prevent from the user's mistakes? how many players are doing the same cube?
yes-ish?
what?
how much is a trailblaze worth?
only??
seriously you already got +4000?
the other day i did when i had a string of trailblazers
How common is it for one end of a branch to end in the middle of a cube, rather than one of the sides?
what's the weird red image that sometimes appears???
when you have it load the picture within the cube, is there a way to have it load around the blue area 1st then populate the rest?
an empty cube??
fill in the blanks?
empty cubes happen when there's a glitch i'm guessing
so then what does "Trailblazing" a cube mean?
I soo dislike it when I map almost a whole thing, from a lil sprout, and only get 20 points...
those little nubbin ones take practice, and i know how frustrating they can be :(
that's even WORSE; when you know what you've done is correct
can you go back and re do the tutorial? I keep getting low scores and I think it may be because I'm messing up or something.
I'm curious how many people here do science for a living
it was the shift key to take out the colored area, correct?
what do you mean from at least 2angles?
you mean two persppectives?
you mean looking in the 3d viewer two angels?
that's how you turn a 60pt into 300 pts
I was wondering why I couldn't do it from multiple axises
did they mention this in the tut?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OG6q7zo6uQ
Why am I only getting trailblazed cubes? the last 10 have been trailblazers ...
what is trailblazed?
what if i find that a branch doesn't come off the right branch from the edge of a cube
like when you move from one cube to another you can see where the branche is  suposed to start, but the branch i'm given to work on is the 
is there a way to report a cube?
Is it somewhat common to have a cube with 4 ends branched off to the sides? Or is it more likely that I made a mistake?
i don't know if I'm getting bad cubes or what
what makes it so sexy?
do explain what that is?
that's what I've heard, anyway
when you are there 7 weeks straight
hahaha I like where is going
you get what we call "camp goggles"
gunedown, I guess it doesn't help that you were on here when I first started 6 hours ago, and you're still here
procrastination level 100?
ugh, I hate it when it crashes
who's brain is this anyway?
okay.. this is as annoying as the consecutive trailblazers. I KNOW I'm doing this right.. but seriously 20 points??
is an admin on?
what are they going to do with all this info?
so there is 3 days left till this thing shuts down?
mapping the neurons helps them understand more about how they work (and what does what)
thanks, also what happens if you colossally screw up, I'm guessing each cube gets double checked by other people?
Neurons lol... sup with you zombi?
you get a flat 50 points no matter how much work you do
people have been taking advantage of that, and it screws anyone coming after when they're big cubes and it doesn't do anything..
so not 50 + whatever you'd normally earn? weird
why do it if not for the research or puzzle angles lol
just dont see the point of being here if thats what youre gonna do
how are you liking the game?
Um, kinda dumb question, but I've only started playing today, and no matter how good or bad I do, I keep getting a flat 50 point.
Why is that?
@armithius are you still in the tutorial?
i accidentally hit esc and when i came back it was showing the same cube but at a different plane
armithius, at the bottom center, does it say "check my work", or have three different buttons?
is it right that im getting some that seemingly need no additions?
what!! cad19 just got 1000 points 
if you get a cube where one click fills in a bunch of stuff, you get big poitns
and what team
hm, Start Over button not working for me (after I confirm nothing happens and all controls but movement are broken). Known issue or just me?
what dos that mean?
I can't even begin to imagine what work went into this
what cell are you working on, cad
i bet he knows where is the big chunk
@bosung it can happen...when you get to certain areas, it's usually the same of several things
is it normal to hit a deadend, or should it always leave the cube?
little dead end, or the whole thing stops in the middle?
hey people! Who's @cad19? New player?
@06david seriously?
been meaning to email you about the trailblazing issue and how it's gamed sometiems
hmm @cad let's see some screenshots of what you've traced
thats how i got some 1ks
or did i some how exploit my 1ks?
the quicker you do more points u get?
I just got here, care to clue me in?
I am on a mac and completely study at screen shots. I dont know how to take one.
my fifth grade teacher made me do that when i got in trouble, which happened a lot
what? -.-
why am I so bad at this?
@corey have you tried looking at the videos on the blog?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OG6q7zo6uQ
hahah @iambykins what is that!
Amy, what are the chances that we could do a mini-contest, maybe for cubes or points earned in a day - and if we reach the goal -
ahem, what would i be doing?
ugh, i hate doing what i think is good then getting 20points
Anderson Coopers staff did it to him - he didn't know what it was or what they were doing, his reaction is hilarious
ooh, the kid one where they start hitting him with the potted tree?
KU basketball?  Can we please start a thread about this on the forum.. YES. 
Hmmm what kinda goal should we set..
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=O0SN0d7vjOo
this one's good too http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbGFYjCbpRs
i love how she's wearing a helmet :P
Anbody see Jon Stewarts one? that made me laugh
when everybody left :D
How are my fellow Eyewire-ers doing today?
someone cheated on cubes?
Why would someone cheat science!?
when you find out they are legit cube solves, i hope you will have enough decency to send an apology
depends on how complicated they are
but it is the internet, so it is what it is
@cad what is your internet speed?
people merely highlighted that you weren't contributing anything here, so why are you here
i had my moment where i used to blow through cubes that seemed easy.. most the time they are but once i slowed down i started finding some
trolling implies im doing this to get a rise out of you, im not, i dont care what you do with your time, im merely questioning what youre
actually come to think of it, scrolling up, i don't see any pt values, or trailblazes from david, so david what are you contributing?
We're on here almost 24/7 anyway. What team are you on? If your points are legit you'll be top player of the day
is eyewire's FB page gonna post  the day's top 10 again?
oh yay!... it's not midnight here yet so I did't pay attention to where I was lol... and YES IFLS! :)
what happens if i mess up? does someone check my work?
oh ok. so were going over the same thing  several times?
What were you guys using that Letter A for anyway?
We can't say, in case sebastian is online. but we will post a pic when the surprise has come :)
Have you guys found all of the letters of the alphabet?
Once you guys found those letters you stoped? D:
amy, do we know if any team is working on a starburst one yet?
I think there are a few starburst branches but mostly other cell types (I don't know what they are)
am i tracing neurons in the brain of particular person?
are these black lines blood vessels?
Did they ever post cube totals today?
that is why I am dedicating all of today to eyewire
i don't really know why i am on reddit team
it gets easier the more familiar you are with how the cells look
How'd you learn of this site?
I'm pretty sure that's what's going to happen
Is the 3d neuron mapping thing on the left working for you?
Hows things been goin?
how are you viper
hows the tracing going?
what's up?
brianwilliamson?
guys? any advice for a newbie... I am terrible at this *sigh*
when u scroll up and down u can see the transition easier
too early?
on the internet?
conyer I have no idea what you're talking about
what is this scocery
I know - what the fuck am i doing
I used to have one... I dont know where it went
can you hear my words?
all the green people... have you declared your team?
what does color mean?
the colour of your name is the team you're playing for.. depending what team you actually *want* to play for
teams are based on how you found out about Eyewire
Team word of mouth anyone? 
what color is IFLS
are u the teamx leader?
Did you post it on eyewire's page?
any admins out there?
why do you get such weird cubes lol
why do i get cubes with two segments in them, but the AI only colors one? and I have no clue where the other is
Only trace what the selected seed may be
It's why you can't see the overview when tracing a cube
from what ive seen
good idea to do that and zip and up and down fast to see what it looks like it's doing
you own a pig? O_o
You live on a farm?
then why do you have a pig and 8 chickens of all things
so, they're pet chickens not gfood chickens?
What color eggs do they make?
blue/green.........?
yeah.. helps to see what the neuron is doing @gran
how so?
does it not have all 6 sides? :P
whats TB?
Shush it I want to TB at least once since last night :| when I joined
what is going on there
How do I do it again?
what team are you guys from?
facebook you?
I don't really know what TB means :-|
I feel that trailblazing should give the person doing it more than 50 points because of how important it is
hm?
how to trailblaze??
how did you manage to finish all the pending one so fast?
that's the main goal,isn't it?
and that's why we cheer on the trailblazers for all their hard work *go viper go* *shaking pom poms* :D
Did that happen to be a nice Y shaped cube?
lol with lots of little holes in it?
not sure why
bug?
or something else?
When you see one, you know you'll see a few more shortly afterwards
another one?
what did that one look like?
what's your time zone?... only 4am here
was the small bit near a corner?
And miguel, you in Hawaii or New Zealand?
eh?
That sucks, esp. when other people are getting 1k =/
adelso I know how trailblazing works
Can someone please tell me why i only get 50 points :(
or are you doing the tutorial?
oh ok thx and how can i get more?
where are you team reddit XD
It was broken? O_o
Any idea why the chat fails?
is there an online-updating score board?
??
It might be where they clicked on the link from?
also what chat team the join doesn't have to match the cell they are working on
It might of just been really fluke randomisation. My partner got Team X when he logged in from work
How far ahead is facebook from reddit?
Does anybody actually care about the whole "competing social networks" subtheme?
who?
Are there any measures in place to prevent people from coming in here and ruining this?
Like just tracing completely arbitrary stuff in the cubes?
A redditor did sabotage a team when we first started. But he sabotaged his own team...so..
Why....
What'd they do?
how silly
How does one trailblaze a cube?
So how many cubes have I done for today?
But is there a way to pick a cube that hasnt been done?
@viper I won't know how many cubes until we get a stat report. It might say in your profile, avg cubes per day
amy, that info disappeared when competition started
hm, you guys aren't able to pop into the database and check?
Can I be an admin pl0x?!?!
is echo on?
@amy, is eyewire pleased with the way cells are looking?
It's not an automated system where you can check up on individual player stats?
@reb pretty good -- we still have to figure out how to improve accuracy. People miss a lot of branches.
Whew! You're team FB yea?
8 hours of trailblazing??
the streak was broken around 8:15AM or so when it finally gave me a couple of normal cubes then went straight back to trail blazing
how's things here
why is that?
So when you try to search something you get ads and amazon stuff
what version? I have 12.10 and I don't have that problem
I haven't used windows 8, what do you mean by "dual personality"
mind_less: What DE/WM are you using?
Anyone here from IFLS?
That's what I would have figured
Did you guys see the NYT article about President Obama's plan to map brain activity over the nexgt 10 years?
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/science/project-seeks-to-build-map-of-human-brain.html?_r=0&adxnnl=1&pagewanted=2&adxnnlx=1361210722-2ZyCq
Tangled?
Is there a Reaper online?
so weekly and monthly points aren't workin then?
so you still haven't picked a team? who ya "playing" for?
but this is still a global chat though right?
i hate the ones where the AI filled everything in perfectly lol. even though that's what they're shooting for
2d flip?
doesnt switch what side it's looking at
How do i know what team im on?
What are we doing anyway? Are we mapping neurons in the brain?
well when they figure out what these neurons do then the AI will be able to map other neurons better and thus in like 10 years they'll be ab
One more thing, how do I choose a team? :)
well, I believe it was just put foreward by the U.S. gov't to start a project to map the brain just like what we did for DNA
are you past the tutorials yet?
you should have chosen one when you signed up, but after that, you can change your color in chat by typing /team whatever
get what?
you trying to join g+?
is it /team g+ or /team google+?
the tutorials are like college, they'll show you extreme examples of stuff when in practice you'll only see the normal stuff
like numbers?
you don't want to see me when i'm angry, mind_less
you wont like it when theyre angry....
I come from the part of 'murica where out of all the english accents, we are the most understandable haha
CO?
I always find it funny when they subtitle 'muricans from the south or some british people, especially farmers
is 1000 the upper limit?
I honestly can't figure out why this is so much fun! 
when you go across the slides really quickly it's mesmerising
when there's not too many newbs asking the same questions over and over again :P
"what does trailblazing a cube mean?"
"how do these points work?"
cus I was one of them when I came in haha
"so what are we actually doing?"
I feel like nobody has ever been outdoors and learned what trailblazing actually means o.O
"is this for a human brain?"
"is this really our brain?"
Are we working on a different neuron than yesterday? It seems less developed on my pgae
you sure you're on the same neuron as yesterday?
and not, say, g+'s neuron?
and there are multiple neurons being worked on right? 
I only watch one subreddit. I'm too video based than text based when it comes to time wasting
don;t you hate it when you think you found an awesome branch, then on closer inspection, realize it isn't a branch?
I wonder what makes the renders look like either solid tubes or cheese curds?
the curds happen when people have worked on it filling in many individual sections
Redditors, we're looking into the spawner to see why your cube count just dropped so much
Is anyone out of tasks?
@amy, does the AI actively learn while we do this? Or is it collecting data for later
or is the lag that bad?
yeah, learning to recognize what's what is interesting. First time I've ever done something like this. 
do you use RES?
@piggybank how do you like it so far? 
EyeWire? It's interesting, and a good distraction to my typically boring day. 
What am I supposed to be doing...?
Can someone explain how points work in this?
20 can happen when you fill in too much
any tips that could help?
is it randomly assigned?
how many of you guys came from IFLS?
@amy, who is your guest in lab?
not entirely sure where freiburg is...
vapu, studierst du an der Universit�t Freiburg?
wo studierst du im moment?
I think it is so cool that without knowing german, an english speaker can sort of understand what is being said
gunedown really? i think german is a very diffucult language :D
@viper how many hours have you played yoday? just curious. 
I'm surprised to meet an american who can speak german ;) where did you learn it cyrius?
or anyone, how long have you all been playing today.
uh, maybe 2-3 hours?
How do you get higher points? I got one really bad score and got 50pts, and then got 100I'm with a journalist talking about the website. He's curious about why you all are playing.
I feel like if we finish, we'll find out why this exists
@Amy...did you get my email from late last night? *red-faced*
Are we graphing a real cell?
It's good brain exercise when I'm taking a break from writing
not cell, sorry, you know what i meant
awesome!  We're going to send this chat log in, is that ok with y'all? 
It's funny how the chat distracts me now from playing :D
I was about to mention how nobody has been getting points
wait SETI does this too?! o.o
mind_less ;) what drugs are you taking?^^
Are these real, ungraphed nuerons?
Does this legally qualify as an addiction?
i'm not sure what the legal definition of an addiction is
if you continue it despite adverse affects?
this is definitely physical! what are you talking about!
@ketta, how close are you to 500k?
wonder if i could use my time playing as volunteer hours?
I guess that depends... is this actually furthering science or is it just a game?
Really? They actually use the data they gather?
and to create a smarter AI that will some day evolve into skynet on its knowledge of the brain and how it works
so..how is everyone this FINE Monday? -_-
how do i know which team to choose?
Hi Ketta I'm good. How are you?
Where did you first hear about the game blue?
@ketta, it's a good day. You? Close to 500k?
Are you Jon Conner?
that's where you can declare your team blue
also we are still looking into why the team cube count is whacked out. 
still? shucks...giving you all kinds of trouble =/
Is it connected to what happened yesterday?
With the cache filling up? We're not sure yet. 
i would like to see what happens if the internet becomes self aware
so, Amy..did you get my email from late last night? ><
have you read the Ender's Game series?
I think the only thing is... what would a senient network even want?
Those times when I wonder if the U.S. Gov't has a contingency plan for AI becoming hostile
i think you cannot have a plan because noone can know what happens if we create a selfaware program
hey gunedown, what makes you think we're all actually human?
that just means we need to create one so that we'll know what to do when one's created ;)
because what sentient program would give itself away?
the problem is: how do you know if you created a sentient program or just a program that pretends to be sentient
when i can't sleep i think of the immensely small scale of things inside us
but... one more?
gunedown what do you have to do?
What?
how do you get more than 50 points in a game?? No matter my score i have been getting the same # of points
so... how does one complete more than a mere 20arranging to miss class so I can play all day. Sick? Dedicated? You decide.
kette which kind of class?
@pinky does the end look normal?
anyone else have trouble with the cube not fully loading? like half of the screen looks like a checkerboard but the other half is fine?
rob, maybe some sort of cell body?
Well, echo said after Tuesday he's doing something to TB. Looking forward to seeing what he does
650? wow so far my best was 45
anybody here from Ireland?
perhaps all the tutorials give you 50 points no matter what
how will we know if we get something wrong once we're out of the tutorials?
you don't have the last word in what it looks like
nice projet .. what will it help ? 
so are real scientists and shit actually going to see these results?
skynet.not?
when did you guys launch this?
no matter ..what .. u are not an etalon 
how do u earn points?
fold was on the PS3 right?
where are you guys located?
what is fold it?
whaaaa?
protein folding ?
have you guys thought about crowdfunding for eyewire?
wow .  not heard about it .. but this... can help in retinal implants?\nwhen does the tute end?
@cindy I have no idea if they have or not...look for the bright yellow names when you're here, those are the admins/devs
@ketta, do you know if someone on the team manages the twitter?
@thana I'm not sure exactly on the implants thing (?)..but I haven't read through all of their stuff yet
cindy what about mykroryza?
Ketta? How long have you been playing this?
From Romania any1?
that sounds very interesting cindy (I misread what thana said earlier)
or are you from there?
is 50 the lowest points one can earn?
20 == when others got it wrong. ;p
mind_less u are on the top !?!?:)
nice . to hear that ... but rest? :) 
hwo about it?
 were u from ? city
did echo already mention how to unsilence the chat?
try /silence again maybe, or /unsilence?
recently?
Where's ketta? I haven't seen him in a while.
Do you know when you have that weird feeling? As if some1 else is in the room?
??
why u say so ? 
@thanogood, .. of course when you start talking that's no longer true.
la vitta e bella !?
wtc, that's why you should yell something like "I know, that you are watching me again" from time to time, if you are alone...
oh? maybe, yeah :D
what's up chumps
hows it goin? Facebook still leading?
and its like, what the heck is that supposed to mean?
today is a holiday?
president's day..yep. We didn't realize that when we started the games. 
oooh, yah i remember that when i used to work in the food service industry
connection comming off it. Is this likely or am I missing something?
are you always taking a long weekend? :D
Making the leaderboard top 10 now -- anyone know what team @aafenton is on?
Anyone know about @molord?
How do I change my country?
how do i join a team ?
?!
Oh c'mon - someone has to ask me: "What?! You get extra points in TeamX?"
Is there even another member at g+? :-P
did any of you IFLS fans see that recent post on there about that little amphibian??
should i skip it?
amylee, are you an admin?
Just saying?
Can someone fill me in on why I can only obtain 50 points for each cube, when I see that others are getting 100+?
are you trailblazing pete?
/msg jamieexq did you fix your chat problem? (I wrote in the forum)
/msg jamiexq Did you solve your chat problem? (I wrote in the forum)
Check?
how did you just get 453 pts?
what does trailblaze mean in this game? trailblazing a cube
Gotcha. Am I the only new guy !? I feel like a moron
Hm, today I am experiencing a lot of missing slice chunks, 3d blocks and once even colored 2d parts... No one else got those?
hey reb :) did you meet your goal for today?
/msg amyleerobinson Is there a way to message a person, that deactivated the chat?
either that..or when you first log in, chat sometimes doesn't show
she goes nuts trying to figure out where to start..here? Here?? HERE???? NO HERE!!! omnomnomnom
that's what i'm thinkin too
lol, when you eat?
cuddling on ALL the girls laps, pete? lol
yeahhhhh man you know what's up! haha
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ5576Pags4
haha, like most guys i think, i don't particularly care for small dogs, but a teeny tiny dog? that would be kinda cool
pirate pete!?
wasn't that the guys name in Dodgeball? lol
Dodgeball reference?
holly knows what's up
I seriously heart Will but all my friends give me death glare when I mention him lol
I stole a HUGE Elf poster from a blockbuster when i was in highschool
did it drive it all the way through the candycane forest?
you know I kinda what the demographics of this competition would look like
do you consider if fun?
what are you guys writing on?
how are we actually helping the scientists? I don't understand
@reb...giving me a glimpse into my future as a grad student?
@pete we are picking up where their AI left off...
have a look at the blog pete ...  lots of detail about what we're doing
@reb, ya! what specifically?
oh goodness geology AND arch? hope you got to go on some fun trips
@reb what region?
@droiniak, why?
So, it's not always like in Indiana Jones as Archaeologist?
I wish I knew what you guys were talking about. I'm a business economics major... ha
and all of this is why I can't wait to get into the BSc program!!!
Why is it that hard to get into?
many competitors?
i'm scrolling back reb and can't see where you said what your thesis was on (or was it the microbial communities in groundwater?)
wish I had thought of that when i was a teenager...but..uh...I did it for science?
He still deactivated his chat, eh?
smalljude, you came from The Shire, right?
Nice, you in NZ? I'm moving there in June
oh great :)  I hope you'll like it. Where to?
Why did you like it? I've heard different opinions. 
New Zealand? did you go there to walk the Lord of the Rings trail to Mordor and hike Mount Doom?
My boyfriend doesn't appreciate where he lives. I'm like shaking him saying "YOU HAVE CLEAN AIR AND WATER!" lol
haha... yeah... was he there for the quakes?
how did it go this morning?
well i went through a few mintues where i started to blow through them once, when i first started, but i wasnt doing it to screw anybody
forgive us, for we know not what we do lol
can you believe that person turned out to be a girl?
so??
lol what is the significance of that?
why's that hard to believe?
Wasn't cad just passing up cubes for the points last night?
how does that work?
i barely saw cad in chat at all.... only caught something about her insulting kettas toaster? lol
that's what we were talking about
thats what it looked like, but i guess they checked her cubes and found that she was adding new stuff to each one
is THAT why I'm getting 20 points for whole branches?!
ahaha so some of you were offended when you thought this person was surprised a "top score" was a girl
when you get to TB'ing, you can just hit i'm finished over and over and get 50 points
but no one is offended that unpleasant is assumed to be a guy?
isn't that kind of sexist too though?
doing no work (except when they could see it was a big point cube)
so guys this is why we should date older lasses lol
i'd honestly rather deal with a mean guy than a girl, they know how to be really cruel
I'm average looking at best, and you know how they can be when they have a superiority complex
when i see your face  -- :) -- i am like, awww
is it me, or I guess that when people trailblaze without doing the work, you get wimpy points when the next to go through?
I wish I could see what other people did after I finish a cube.
just so I can see what I might have done wrong
or where you were right and they weren't
did you people learn nothing from Aladin?! no wishing for more wishes!
but what if I used some of my wishes to wish for more wishes? oooooh
especially when they start singing...*rolls eyes*
did anybody else ever see the version of the little mermaid where ariel commits suicide with a knife at the end?
and turns into sea foam?
what? is that some youtube thing :P
me too lamby, i've read them a few times :P was beside myself when i heard there was going to be a show
cause you know how they split the same timeline into two books but diff characters?
@aafenton that is EXACTLY why i love GRRM so much
any Dark Tower readers on here?
what's neat about the GRRM series is that loads of people who haven't tried or liked fantasy before have loved his books
anybody read it? it's about a private in the Napoleonic Wars
anyone else here tend to read 2 or 3 books at the same time?
the one with dragons (in the napoleonian  war)?
how do you declare team agian
then come here and type /team whatever and you'll show what team you're on
that means that I'm not declared?
Teams are based on how you found out about Eyewire lol
really?
is that what the colors are?
what team you're on...?
but that's just how it's supposed to work lol
the colors are just what you want them to be
wasn't reddit winning for a while?
the one in africa?
viper's right, that is how they set up teams..but it's no biggie
no but I remember seeing it... do you recommend it?
yep. kinda disturbing. And the english teacher that gives up on a job when her kids are starving. that was a big bug for me
but when they pull you out of the movie to show you some white dude's face taking up the entire screen with a blank nodding expression... 
even when they do it in Princess Bride
they did a good job on he cg tiger...I watch a lot of nature shows etc, and I did the total girly thing and cried when i saw how...
...skinny the tiger got when he left
it's been really hard to see all my colleagues losing their jobs when they should be enjoying it all
why move somewhere like that when it can change?
so it's nothing personal, just...not where i want to be
really why north carolina?
Lamby, That's how I feel about living in Nashville
I'd love to find out how many cubes I've done and how many of those were TBs lol
What sort of fix was he going to make?
8 hours of nothing but TBs good enough? lol
Seriouslu?
my real question here, is how do you have 8 hours to do this?
Man I'm sorry. I'll try to take some from you. Is that how we got that big line?
oh really?
I was wondering what was up with it :P
So we messed up?
We're mapping a neural network to see how the J cell is connected to other neurons
How can I find out how many cubes I've worked on today?
Yea, I can't wait to see the visuals of how the cells are connected. I think Jinseop and crew will start working on that tomorrow and have
https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10200093249351993&set=o.378553375498465&type=1
started it when I began my jam and jelly business (it's a SMALL etsy business, but I make killer jam :P)
well, that's basically what I'm doing..
@viper OMG send them!  I haven't made an announcement on Facebook -- what's your fav letter sent it and I'll repost
e?
Yea @Ketta! Is it in the Forum? I think I've seen it if it is -- perfect J indeed
https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=507103589310109&set=a.506814006005734.109921.378553375498465&type=3&theater
want the rest of my letters?
I guess that's how fast a TBd cube gets reviewd
Does this mean we can flood the eyewire page with photos of the cubes that resemble letters?
so what are the chances we are going to see a Harlem Shake video?
of eyewire?
hi...are you looking for me?
not gangnam style?
did you show him the video amy?
is there any way to load more than one slice at a time?
Haha ok I'll let you know when its up.
@viper have any others? That N looks cool but kinda not that much like an N to us :)
when you requested for an A
how do u get 1k?  most i have got was 500
they're cubes where you add a ton of stuff
I thought you were blazing viper?
I'm not even that interested in the score today, I just want to know how many cubes I did and how many of those were TBs
how is everyone?
how can you tell if you're trailblazing anyway?
Which is why accuracy is important
Because people will automatically be assigned cubes form the merged cell, and then when it comes time to prune stuff, that work goes byebye
what to make for dinner...
calc?
You want help?
"oh you're having trouble with integrals? but those are so easy..."
I hate doing it, and especially when I was actually in school I kept wondering how would I ever use this later on in life.
depends how the person teaches... grandfather is a math mathematician but I suck at it :S 
fine arts?, Jay?

the RWBY (What I linked) stuff looks REALLY good
What'd geh hoal?
what's the goal*
bipolar? ;)
hey guys, is there any purpose on pledging allegiance to?
so really no purpose for us eh?
doesn't matter what gets erased
when I hyperfocus
dafuq am I reading?
want us to remind you to get drinks and go to the loo?  :)
No matter what I do, that one thing consumes my thoughts
can you decide which thing to focus on.. or no control?
hows it going?
how's eyewire been behaving tonight, everyone have enough cubes?
oooh, did you make that popcorn?
to the corner store?
you *are* jelly or you have some viper?
jelly=jealous?
did someone say jelly?
stroganof??
stroganawfull?
If you want to hear gross, let me tell you about what I ate in Uganda
but as ice cream? whew!
which did you guys pledge allegiance to?
anyone want to hazard a guess what's in it?
fat?  blubber?
seal blubber?
So Grim, I'm curious what do you do at MIT?
oh goodness MIT?
I went running, have you peeps been here the whole time?! :O
GrimReaper: What would you normally do, if you weren't doing this?
Are you like a professor or something?
are you guys out jamie?
reddit running low too?
can you find out how many cubes I did today? I'm still curious
sane?
senile?
Which is which?
wait jamie, didn't you just say you were out?
Oh, when you stop doing trailblazers, is it because you ran out of new cubes to do?
what team are you Holly?
how did you find eyewire?
what is team x? 
why no 4chan team>
?
Can we have a 4chan team?
I'll join team x since I found out about the project from my students in my lab. How do I join team x
wait... /team with the space or without it?
is that plants?
animator @jay?
at school or working?
ugh why must this neuron be so fugly
where?
I forget the numbers, but doesn't insanity set in at like 150 hours?
loading is slow for me.. anyone else?
you there Grim?
echo's email was echo@mit.edu right?
today's cubes have been boring.. funny how they can feel so different
merger jude?
do i need to check or can you handle it?
how will you know which cube she was on from a screenshot?
but you wouldn't really know when I took the screenshot
Now I need to go email Echo to see how many cubes I did today
i forgot what I was lol
who else was up here?
@viper you have his info right? 
Does it tell you that you ran out of cubes?
@jamiexq every day?  Would you email us when you get that message so we can look into it?
@viper how long did you play today?
amie, null cubes?
You're saying like 23 hours?! I know you were on last night when I got on
I know, but 8 straight hours of it? ;p;
but there is no time factor with trailblazing - you get 50 pts no matter what
Which is why I'm so curious as to how many cubes I did today
TO take care of all this spawner and discuss the games and what not
lol earliest?? 
I can see that! I remember when I worked overnights
We've gotcha taken care of -- we can only fix what we know is a problem :)
Out of curiosity, did anyone else on Team X run out of cubes? 
It's too good? 
So, I just had the page crash. When I reloaded I got my same cube, but the slices went perpendicular to what they were...
do you want it back the other way @jf2l?
Did I miss that part in the tutorial?
hehe... I think the ones they had when I started were very different to the ones now
they weren't working to well when I did them. Lots of low-res quadrants
jf2l did you just skip through them?
woah jamie, it is hard keeping ahead of you when you earn over 400 at once
I hate that, it makes you harken back to the good times when you were earning 50 points blazing trail
Amy can you see the cube I'm on now?  possible merger but if I try to screencap the 2D disappears
That's what the 2D actually looks like
When we select segments in it, it highlights a particular color of red that is then sent back to the servers
It's how the game knows what we're selecting
Viper, with your time attack idea, do you think it would cause people to make too many errors?
Well, it's why it would be only done on already trailblazed cubes. Errors would be much easier to spot
I was wondering when the next one was going to be anyway
haha we'll talk about how we love you guys and we want the games to be fair and engaging and never ever ever have spawning errors 
that is what I meant
why do you hate us?!?!
It's why I wanna listen in!
haha you guys I am so obnoxious to the team this week -- any time something pops up I immediately email "what's up, the cube counts are off!
IT: "Amy, have you tried turning it off an on again first?"
btw jaimie, how do you unsilence chat?
@jaimie what's the command for unsilencing chat?
that's exactly what I was afraid of doing :P
lol what is going on with Twitter's cell?
What's up with it?
Amy, how come sometimes I get a cube that is already marked up?
@andrew what do ya mean?
andrew, is it marked up correctly? are there a lot of marks or just one or two?
When it loads, it comes up with the branch from the AI and what would be the same as if i marked it as well.
as though it was already complete? Those are generally cubes that have been mapped well by another person
when you see one that cools correct and submit without adding, it helps the AI learn that the cube is mapped completely
so if we did complete trailblazing someone else gets a complete cube?
Well on my computer, yellow is what comes up with the AI and orange is what I mark. This is half yellow and half orange and I haven't 
haha yea, has your cat been sneaking on to play eyewire? 
where's Arnie when you need him? 
andrewb did you take a screen?
RAWRR! Don't know what to tell you so I roar in stead. The devs have been notified of a point bug.
I just earned 4 points but did anyone see it? Psh, i didn't. 
I think it is due to the fact that when you say your finished, it always gives you another
what? Sexy? did someone finally bring sexy back?
u do? O_o
;p; and yes amy... I for one feel cheated when I get a trailblazer =/
Amy should I post this screenshot to the forums?
ok now I have to go to bed. 1,000 points today woot! #11..we'll see how low I am by the time 8 am rolls around ;p
What's the easiest way to post an image to the forum?
aww do you have a cold jay?
lol don't worry, not with what we're doing to it! >x]
whoa Isaac Asimov.... what robot revolution?
XD what I loved about isaac Asimov
maybe that's the positive outcome? :P
yeah.... but I guess imagining how something can go right also makes you ponder what can go terribly wrong
in a world ruled by robots do you know the first thing we'll lose?
rotary phones?
well... yeah, look at us, give a man a spear for fishing, and iron for.. well, cast iron pans?  and we end up with Spartans... 
Found any good neurons today?
logic? lol
I do nazi what's so funny about that
a what?
a trope... that's how fancy english people say troop
Tea?
like neurons haven't? lol
Yeah I hate it when my life gets ruined forever.
So who goes to college? Anyone?
was it Roosevelt who said: "forever is a lot longer than today."?
Kinda? haha
HMMM. FDR or Stalin?
Cooldridge?
Garfield?
Wilson?
Taft?
all of them?
McKinley?
at the same time?
So explain to me how you kinda go to college
which uni?
Canada, Eh?
oh yeah! born and bred.... how about you? college? a/s/l.... hahaha
Wanna die? Just wear the wrong color rag
Canada isn't that dangerous, is it?
and nah canada is pretty safe but when we get a jump in crim everyone makes a big deal about it
My neighbor was from Canada when I lived in germany. She made me a cake!
are you really the super liberal stereotype?
are you doing highence again? :P
Do you know that feeling when you receive an awesome paycheck?
yep. I mean, no one has ever died from substance abuse of marijuana haha. That's why I don't drink alcohol :)
No matter. what are the public schools like in Canada?
haha, why's that?
why's what?
Why were you home schooled?
it's been an adventure for sure.... how did you find it?
yeah I'm super chatty and social when I'm out but I really like alone time so it wasn't bad.... and hell yeah painting!!!!!
what do you like to paint?
?
see, and this is why i yelled "Danny :D" when i saw you on chat :)
and why I yelled back "Aafenton!" then "Ashlyn"
what? thats awfull
?
will you?>
How do I do this?
have you done the tutorials?
could be wrong trailblazing?
Where's the rest of the 1Ks, they come in groups most of the time
taking their time?
to what?
brainiac425 how the heck did you manage that?^^
anybody else have issues when they submit?
you see no proceed button when you submit?
tried reloading?
what if you try resizing your browser window a little bit?
@echo- could you see my chat a second ago?
I'll have to read through my error logs to see what went wrong
if you could go ahead and work it out to where i could just get paid to do this, that would be better
how do you get 806 points???
is it not working for you either?
echo: Did you fix that SSL thing?
Do you know how long it will take/how to fix it?
I know how to fix it
Now that we fixed the problem?
anywhoo, I'm off for lunch.  Just wanted to check in and see how that was going
how do you get to trailblaze one? is it random?
what does that mean btw? to trailblaze
whay time is it? i've got 7 pm :P
cad19 are you on?
vapu, you're german?
;) where do you ive
ah nice, then you know what you have to bring besides the pizza and the beer x)
So .. when do the games end?
midnight east coast time?
though we're thinking about a 24 hour blitz bonus round where if all players map x cubes by Friday, the lab will make a harlem shake vid
Just went away for a while and still the slices only loaded when I went to them.
how do you have a collaborative round @ whatthecode
Slice .. Y U No load!?
@ketta, thought you weren't going to school today? :)
It's with slow loading like this ... it's all the more frustrating when that exact segment you need takes ages/or doesn't load. :)
did the AI change? i'm getting lots of cubes with disjoint segments auto-highlighted
hm did the facebook projekt change? it doesnt look like earlier this day
@tets you mean the cell?
where it's not showing all we've done due to cache filling up or something like that
but then it should be more not less right?
hey Amy :) how'd your power meeting go?
currently working on a cube where only what I color is showing in 3d (other weirdness too, which I'm sure you already know about)
why do I get 50 points for every cube? regardless of the are you on the tutorial?
what i didnt get any points in the tut
do you still have a 'check my work' button?
how do i get out then?
how many are there?
its still the tutorial?
do you have a 'check my work' button?
Didn't it say .. we will give you x more cubes before you can start?
What did you break?
Hmm new observation .. preloading only stops working when I rotate my slices?
preloading?
oh, i see what you mean
@echo what the hell are you doing? :)
all kinds of weird stuff today...just sent in a screen where the 3D initial shading never loaded but showed what I shaded
feeling slow?
but reb you're having trouble?
how long was it slow for ketta?
I believe, you were trying to mock me :D http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2u5gyzr&s=6
cells look strange, lots of reaping?
@reb what do you mean by reaping?
am I using the term incorrectly?
how is it nkem
Top 10 Players allegiance question: anyone know whose team @mind_less is on?
hey @buco, what team are you on?
anyone know about @dec_60's affiliation?
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFRkS0haSVRjUDBON25SYW9JbnlhUlE6MQ#gid=0
ah I figured out how to decipher from stats. nvm :)
anyone not seeing the graphic in the background?
is there any graphic in the backgroud?
well what part you are doing
sometimes i dont get how these points are given out
and points given for cubes you did in the past and turned out to be correct? *evil grin
Hey @echo i have a question: what is the point of cubes with just a little segment to be "traced" on a coner of the cube
i can't see any colors when the AI is supposed to be coloring
are you in one now?
what's going on?
If you click 'I'm finished' and "submit".... and you get nothing...  server is too busy, or I'm off in the weeds?
can email me?
hmm?
is that what caused no coloring?
... so you fixed it?
@echo it seems some cubes are missing from the overview, could that be caused by the problem with the database too? 
i'll do what i can with what i can see, maybe talk to someone. thanks =)
why the cubes shows it up like htat?
i wanted to know what is the purpose of those cubes
has anyone on team x noticed that none of our progress is showing?
hows it goin? facebook still leading?
did I miss any excitement?
extend it or figure out where the progress went
you've done every flippin' cube haven't you?
what's it doing?
take a screen of it, and maybe see what amy/echo want done with it...she suggested sending it to support@eyewire.org earlier
ah team x, out again?
talking of correcting. neuron, with or without e at the end in english?
or what they call it in my part of town.. whats that ugly thing sticking of his spine lol
how big is a 1000? is it the most you can have?
i have had some that where big and took forever but only got 20.  so i was wrong(dont think so) or ai is funny
the outer bits are what's important
I just selected it to see how big it was
?
?
I wonder what the propuse of the chat is
having dicussion with fellow neurone traillers?
@vienna717 what did you do?? :)
what happened?
that's what I'm trying to find out...vienna is yellow like echo
yeah what?
what's up nazuzya?
why not nazuzya?
what browser are you on?
I assume you've tried refreshign/relogging and all that?
that would make me nuts..and you're the one who said earlier you'd emailed echo?
oh no.. again?
are your points based at all on how long it takes you?
yeah I think so... not exactly sure what can't say how much 
What are you studying>
?*
what are you studying mindless?
reason why i was late getting home today was I met w/ one of my professors and she wants to be my advisor
that's kinda how I feel about trying to get into grad school o.O
1000 points? woot!
dangit :( I haven't played that much today, i don't understand why I'm trailblazing
hey m121... are you trying to change your name to FB?
so, if today's the last day of competition, does anyone know whether it's ending at 3 (the time it started last wed.) or midnight?
but if I remember correctly, there will be a 24 hours bonus round where all teams are working together...
would amy or grimreaper happen to be on here?
Dear @Grimreaper, if you're out there, is there any known way to get out of a trailblazeathon like Viper had?... also it keeps sending me to
They are a legit part of the neuron?
that they exist in eyewire? or the coloring
oh echo, am I glad to see you.... could you tell me if there's any way to stop getting these trail blaze cubes? please and thank you
why would you want to stop trailbazing?
what is "trail blazing" if you don't mind me asking
but would retroactive points make people happier?
is it the ones with no changes?
what if we took away the trailblazing bonus?
how long has this project existed?
I heard we may all get to trace together for a day?
how do trail blazing errors get fixed
so (though i am trying to be accurate as possible) if i make mistakes it won't ruin my teammates lives? lol
What if eyewire became friends with facebook?
as a technology partner you mean laure?
we're not sure how much benefit there is to doing that
I don't see any points... no luck?
do you already have an idea?
when you trailblaze you'll get a token in the top right of the page
when two others do the same cube, the token will materialize into points
Really? I never noticed, lol
are there any other coders? besides echo and matt?
three people? woow
where can I change the country? I don't live in the UK
I can change it, what country would you like
is that country code CH?
Gr�essech is it here where I live.
I hate it when things look like they fit together so well but it looks so wrong
like you can't move on?
or it won't score you?
thoughts?
Actually I probably shouldn't be working on this when I'm this tired
Do they come back to you way later?
nope, are you still on it laure?
or was it the last one you saved?
What do you mean (@echo)
you joined like right when we started
Would it be possible to log such information?
Which cubes a user worked on, how many points did he get...
what's trailblaze mean?
we do log who finishes when and what cubes you work on
Woah, but that means, you could not just "recalculate" points for trailblazers, but all cubes?
Also those where the GrimReaper has to participate and correct something...
yeah...I love the concept of trailblazing and will like it a lot more when/if you start the retroactive poitns
I know I was in the top ten for accuracy, not sure where I stood there though
and I think smalljude is still the most accurate?
where do you see that?
when people *want* to trailblaze more, it could be really interesting
When there is no contest going on, do you think people will be as point crazy?
top ~30possibly, but with retroactive points I can't imagine why
so with that implementation, we should be able to see our accuracy?
How do you become the person who does the verification?
Was wondering that the other day when amy was describing what some of the other folks do on the project
Is anyone else in NY?
Are we that few and far between? lol
or WA for that matter...sarabc is closest to where I grew up though :P
that's why people were running out
and ty Laure, for reminding me when I see something cool like eyewire that I want to get in on, don't be afraid to email and BEG
how are the points scored?
@iron they're based on how you compare to others who've done the same cube, volume, and a little bit on time
multiple ppl my office are having issues getting out, why here is working no idea lol
getting out?
ugh, that's about the fifth cube where I *know* it's not 20 points, but that's what I get =/
where do you go to see your stats like accuracy?
I know, right?
you all would be happy enough if you just get points though right?
you should tell Amy when you hit it
woah? You don't cheat, echo? I would have put myself to the top of the highscore :D
where can i check my raking
you don't see the highscore to the right?
hm, or do you mean your overall points in the lower left?
what?
I need a message for chat for when people earn points for things they trailblazed a while ago
[name] earned xxx points for trailblazing?
weird?
Is it over?
refresh the browser?
But ... are the games still on or not?
oh, now I see what you meant with "juicy cube"
you've got a good one nkem?
He's going to wear a star-suit is he?
yeah?
slow loading anyone?
isn't that what "echo" means?
'did I fall asleep?'
do you mean like the show dollhouse?
@echo Whatever happened to testing? ;p j/k
can i finish my cube first?
ok... so... better refreshing everything, hm?
if you click start playing do you not rejoin the same cube adelso?
The chat message is also "ready"?
hm?
for retro points you mean?
@eho Seems like a bug, I just got 1000 points but I don't see them. COuld you fix it please? ;p
the retroactive TB points are only from a few hours ago though right?
how many do you usually trailblaze in a row?
What? Retrospective trailblazing is implemented?
SO you no longer get 50 points for them?
In a way it isn't fair what they did with prolonging the competition ... (not that I care)
which is when it was supposed to
But then now it's free for all?
hmmm?
@nkem what did you do? Just not continue further on the merged part?
can we solve your confusion somehow?
I guess the "0 points" were not planned?
@echo .. can you check my cube?
should i have seen some retroactive points by now?
Never saw that before, which makes me think it's a merge error, but I wouldn't know where.
here's what we're doing with the data yall are helping create http://blog.eyewire.org/how-does-eyewire-help-science/
Something you would only spot if you know what to look for. :O
ohh I think I know where that bug is coming from
And back? :/
team x cell?
Hmm ... It jumps around depending on how far I zoom in/out? :?
I'm on a laptop. Is there a way to zoom without a mouse?
What do the points get you
All depends on what laptop you have.
How do you usually scroll? :) Just do that.
echo, should I check the Start-over thing again?
why the discrepancy with the points?? 
discrepeancy how?
can you elaborate?
Just so you don't get points for what the AI is doing for you.
Not always. You can easily get < 20 points with small segments where you only need to add 1 small piece and can do so fairly quickly.
some cubes I can tell where I made a mistake, others i am clueless....
What I find less fair is adding 12 small pieces on one long stretch of dendrite, getting 24 .. or  adding 3 huge chunks on one long dendrite
Hmmm ... might be subjectivity playing a role here. :) That these big chunks are more entertaining and time flies faster? Don't know.
There is this neat partition image that determines what has to be filled when clicking on some part of the image (those red ones)
@nkem?
hm, don't know how to describe it...
Nah .. when I do that all kinds of bad memories of web development pop up.
if most people are bad at this, what's the point?
why do you think, most people are bad?
But when cubes are revisited and x amount of people do find an extra branch, it is still added.
or whatever you call it when a big part of the cube is filled
GrimReaper? May I call upon your great wisdom for this cube? I have no idea, where to coninue...
I mean - is that even a valid branch?
or are these multiple merged ones?
so I think what you have looks ok, but needs filled in more
hokay, what did I miss?
@Grim you still want us to just fill in the outer bits on cell bodies?
you have a  cell body?  
doing the outside isn't so bad; I just want to do what you guys want
and it can't be very fun to work on can it?
the retro points...they are additional to the 50 you would have gotten?
you get 50 right when you do it
retropoints are live?  WOO!!!
I mean--let's say for others, it's worth 54 points. That means I'd get 4 points or 54 points?
@Amy looked at that article...it's great. What they're doing looks interesting and kinda fun
Did the colors switch from the first screenshot?
Ah, ok... lets see, what this cube is worth...
did you try it?
can you check your javascript console for errors nkem?
so funny how I can go from a huge tb streak to getting points normally
how many times did that error appear?
and how many times have you clicked "I'm finished"?
when i click on "submit"
did you hit start over ever?
ready to try it again?
did you start over ever herbertg?
on this or the previous cube?
the left side of the screen (3D) is showing only the "shell" on the neurite, instead of a "full" tube. does anyone share this error?
what's wrong now?
that look like 20 points to you?
Blue is the part you did?
or the AI?
what
did the one click add a ton?
how many hours left?
what am I supposed to do with the holes INSIDE one of these big blue chunks? fill it all up or WHAT?
Does the cell bodies hurt our accuracy if we dont map all the pieces on the inside?
That's what I've been wondering
Ok so just keep with the outside?
I thought that was the point of them?
The back side?
sure, see how it looks flat, how it makes contact with the edge of the cube?
well whenever it's flat at the edge of the cube it means it's made contact, and that contact is what tells the AI where to continue coloring
So color all those right?
so that big flat part, the AI already knows where to color, the little dents are where it doesn't know
So I don't need to color the dents in the flat part?
Has anyone else been stuck with trailblazing every cube they get today?
when do those come in?
what cell are you working on?
I'm not sure how to ID a particular cell
seems like there are some redditors working besides you today...have you seen what the trailblazing point messages look like?
I'm sorry for my continued ignorance but what do you mean by TB point messages? 
How many of them are coming up or who are responsible for the TB's?
so, w/ retroactive points, when you trailblaze you get an automatic 50 points...
..then when other people come behind you and work on that cube, you get additional points you would have gotten had you worked it normally
how's*
?
Does anyone else ever look at the slides and see faces in them?
shared psychosis? lol
have you dreamt of tracing yet?
actually I have.... especially when I'm dozing off
ooh nice... what are you taking andrew?
And the fact that we know so little about the brain Imagine what it will be like when we study it more.
May I interject?
correct me if i'm wrong but my understanding is the neurology focuses more on what can and has gone wrong, whereas neuroscience provides a 
How our brains have evolved to form very intricate and specific patterns and pathways, with all these kinds of hidden subconscious gems.
May I join?
Sure, I see no reason why not to!
isn't it in general like this when comes to medicine?
if I get into the physiology program I'm hoping for it'll be a tough choice between specializing in neuro or neo natal.... how people think 
*and how people are made
so when these "games" are over can we still map stuff out?
don't crows actually teach the next generation?\nKind of like parots mimicking ability?
apparently they never use it in the wild?
What are you, the Penguin??
is there a way to see the cubes that surround yours without leaving the one you're working on?
it'd be nice to see how mine connect cus there's a path that splits and I can't be sure which one is right
I wonder if we've shown improvement on the spaghetti neurons? The long thin ones
passed?
what about g+?! lol
did echo disable the retro-stuff?
isle of misfit toys?
TB?
is there any redundancy to the cubes? (ie edge of one may be in middle of another)
High Latency means = I'll send all images in one huge container, right?
oh, wow - "kaputt" is really a english word?
just slow loading?
When we talk about slow loading, we mean over 10 minutes, sometimes?
I would not know how to prevent you from doing that :-P
You want to know?
So .. what I often do after finishing a cube (especially possible merge errors) is going back to the overview.
When I then click start again, I go back to the same cube, and I'm finished stops working.
is the overview working for you all?
It was empty for me just now, should I check again?
anyone else find it extremely daunting after you finish the tutorial and you realize there is no "right answer" anymore? :)
Saw the join date when logging in.
lol just a lil bottis, but don't fret. It's peer reviewed and anything you do idn't etched in stone. It's compared to what others have done 
mine still says jan, when it was really feb
what's the difference between the hellow and black modeling?
but maybe it is all cached? better clear it
ah ok. And scientifically, what's the big black thing supposed to be? like what part of the neuron?
Why they are no longer interest can mean it's a fault (e.g. merge error), ... or they 'know enough'.
That's how I understood it.
Ok I got that part, I'm just curiouse why that black part is so big! what part is that?
and that's where the signals originate from? do these "veins" transfer the info?
anyone have tips on determining if its a ending or keeps going when its hard to tell
axons are signal out?
So we are tracing stuff were things go 'in'? :) anyone care to comment and possibly correct me? :)
Define huge? SAC cells have these regular 'synaptic boutons' on them.
At least that was what was confusing for me when I tried looking into it. :)
well if you can't see anything telling you not to go ahead, then we'll see if anyone else traces the same path. Is that an ok way to do it?
Discussion was about the usefulness(?) of punctuation
Funny how you build up this internal metnal of 'how things should be'.
right?
... so, will this run on the PS4? :)
PS4...? If you mean any of Sony's Playstations, then I doubt that it would.
Hey, Jamie - did you know, that your #1 Alltime-Eyewire-Scorer?
wow, really?
or was it Amy who said it? not sure...
What you say? Can we still win?
well, I thought our completed cube numbers are very close aren't ther?
oh god, id that why they call him the reaper? all that cutting of cells :S lol
Yeah! It's awesome to see how I just had 3 very likely merge error cubes.
How many more hours? :)
midnight tonight?
see? jamie also says midnight
Belgium is GMT+1, wtc?
so how far ahead is team x?
how'd they determine who's in this chat channel?
is it everyone who's logged into the app atm?
let's see how many we can get to help count the umber of people
does anyone know how many people are in here already?
You can count how many cubes you trace. ;p
oh, no... why am I the trailblazer?!
What team is @architect on?
lol why?
phew??
Well ... last time I checked reddit is no immediate threat?
aren't you scared of ME?
what about now?
lambykins! what have you done????
Who is the race really down to right now? Facebook and Team X?
.. but how good is not hearing, if you are able to see! (get the matrix pun?)
where are my vipers when i need them...:D
echo, could you check out for mergers in the facebook cell and erase the wrong cubes? :D
retro still being slowish?
is that when it starts or when it updates?
so people have been mapping these out for a year?
any tips for doing a good job?
Some1 here? This cube is untraceable.
So I tried logging in last night on my Mac to no avail. Any thoughts?
I can't belive how close it is *exciting*  !!
Dammit seriously?
how can I help facebook lose?
how can i help facebook win?
ifls?
where's echo
submission is down? really? 
Oh well, FB is a cube ahead you said?
refresh and start on a new cube?
lets all refresh, shall we?
I don't know what team I'm on, but the last time I was online I thought I was on team IFLS given the conversation that was going on in the c
lambykins...fire?
you were just smelling something burning?
? :/
Your watch?
Ah .. k. Any other way I can send the ID of this cube or something in any way?
what's wrong w that cube?
?
You guys have been WATCHING US?!
hahah we added that for when there are players who want us to see their cube
? There's another dendrite running right through it.
how are you guys planning on breaking it down?
how is the winner team going to be decided?
I don't know what to tell you -- sopmetimes there are holes like that
what's the question wtc?
Is this cube fubar .. or is this normal?
the hole in it?
Hmmm are you seeing what I'm seeing?
maybe from a different orientation?
@wtc that's what we're seeing
Either way. perhaps just write down the ID?
I see what you mean there are distinctly two parts at one point
@amy do you know if they've seen improvements on the long thin oens?
am I just really bad at this? I keeping getting 10-20 points a cube.
anyone knows why i just keep getting 50 points?
see you when team x win :D
Who was I talking to earlier about the Life of Pi book?
did you like it WTC?
Yah, I thought about that whole thing with the beginning about how "This story will make you believe in God" I thought it was a bit odd..
how's it going guys and gals?
The basis of the story was it doesn't matter if you are religious or not. It's how you get there that counts.
no 3D, is it just a load issue?
so is eyewire going to be gone gone after tonight?  
Doesn't anyone have some homework or something?
Really? I like it because it doesn't remind me of video games. But I don't play them very often, so I wouldn't know. 
wait, who said reloading fixed 3D?
How do you people multitask like this?
is there a redtube team?
super wrong?
nkem whatcha need?
How about that 'flag for the grim reaper' feature huh. ;p
Hi Amy! That's what I have heard but I don't think my team is doing any of my cubes. 
machine learning?
what is an "epic user"? :D
with color commentary?
ok, so sounds like ketta, viper and nkem all interesteed?
is jamie a guy or a girl?
what's the problem thom?
does it give you "completed" parts sometimes? had one that didnt seem to have anything to add to it
i don't know how they'd do it though
hi all... only 3 hours left?
GrimRepaper: Anything you want me to try before kicking the cube to the curb?
Can you also see what last accessed cubes are?
wow... wish I'd had more time.. I'll see what I can do for the last 3 hours
@Grim, could you check my cube? Fraid it starts out with an AI error.
grim, almost embarrassed to ask again but do you want to take a peak at this one again?
GrimReaper: So, kick it to the curb?
@thom, so it's just not letting you progress past check my work?
was it a fat piece and a small one side by side, wtc?
GrimRepaer: From "Are you sure you're done with this cube?" , selecting Submit dismisses the dialog box but then nothing happens
@Grim .. do you need a snapshot of this merger or can I go ahead and skip it?
@Grim, you get notified of skips?
skip?
ready when you are Grim, no hurry though. You sound plenty busy!
wait, you're in the tutorial and it let you skip cube?
what do i even do
@thom, but skip cube fixed it?
the tutorial just told me what to click
now i have no idea what to do
How does it know what is right and wrong?
what's the point of asking me if it knows what's right?
ah. how much longer on the tutorial?
lol, what tutorial does it say it's on
oh weird, post that as a bug in the forum?
at team x, how are you doing for cubes
@cptaaron would you mind?  helos us keep track f bugs
how do u get points for trailblazing?
sry if u answered. eyewire froze on me.  how do u get trailblaze points?
@jlovin as before, you get 50 points when you trailblaze...
wiper just got 66?
then retroactive points will appear when others of trailblazed your cubes, in addition to your 50
do u have to be online to get the retro points?
do holes ever happen?
what if we win because I summoned one of the vipers w/ my awesome brain powers?
so it's only counting cubes and not amount of neuron added?
@dandune that's ok -- its validating -- when several people map the same cube without adding anything it helps the system establish truth
totally know how that feels
how much does speed matter?
cell body?
finish or skip?
just do the edges.. that's what's important
so would u get 950 viper? 1000 - 50 fr tb?
I think I might have a cell body too, can you check for me Amy?
what is a cell body?
whoa, I had an innocent looking flat slice of neuron that exploded into what I think you guys are referring to as a cell body...
so should I be doing it or skipping?
actually when you guys get to a cell body try to skip it
so to skip or not to skip??...
actually it's mostly because it isn't scientifically useful because we can tell where the cell body it
I'm starting to feel guilty when ever I have to walk away:p
Amy would y'all be able to set up an eyewire store?
sure, I don't see why not
did you fall asleep?
Ketta, I find that to be true for myself regardless of what I am trying to talk to people about
echo: can you see why i can't save my cube?
do you know the points then?
echo: ty, auntdeen has nothing but good to say about you and i see why
:o what'd they say?
where are you based? 
really? well that works out then! :)
Why are points so easy to get today?
anyone out of cubes?
think you're better than me?!?!?!?!?!
If you know what I mean ;)
how many points were needed to become top scoring player of all time again? I've refreshed. 24K someting.. 
Is that right?
@grim are you around?
viper?
Is there a way to tell them about this cube in particular?
So amy, when do I get my scholarship?
was that there originally?
1 billion points in EyeWire = full ride at MIT, didn't your teacher tell you?
it's okay?
Grim do you work for MIT?
What's your job?
well then that is what's going wrong here
the 3D isn't updating what's on the 2D
have you guys ever met Michio kaku? haha
nope, who's that?
yeah I was about to call it a night when I saw the fb post
so who's winning?
where are my fellow team xmates
Oh yeah, echo still hasn't replied to me about how many cubes I did the other day :[
so how does this contribute to science?
did you hit 500k? ketta???
@viper, 75k eh?
how many is a million in the US?
478 points? Do you like trailblazing now viper?
so was is determined that 34477 was highest score?
hey...didn't he beat it? was it like 34400 or somethign?
I know you did, we all make mistakes though, that is what makes us human, Ketta
I did it?
If it just shows you everything right when you finish anyways whats the point?
@mastermapper are you doing the tutorial? if so, those are known
How many till im done the tut?
mastermapper, any idea how many cubes you did after it stopped giving you the progress bad?
@aafenton how long have yu played today?
All day??
anyone in Vancouver"?
Where are you from Ketta?
@mindstate: vancouver WA? I just moved from Portland down to Albany
Ahh ok. I have some friends up there. Idk what city though
can I maybe fly instead? lol
you'll know it when you see it
e meeting..... whats the best way to stay in tough?
touch?
Do you guys want an open or private group?
Can you do open? Some of us don't talk all the time. :)
I'll join as soon as I figure out how to find the rest of my neuron.
How are scores looking with 20 minutes left?
We have how long left?!
Another record?
he did...but didn't we kinda suspect already?
so, how do you change the color of your username?
what are you jamming to?
So everyone on Team FB votes for naming the cell IFLS?
iwonder, make sure there's a space between team and facebook. that was my mistake when I couldn't get it right
Abbrivated or spelt out?
that way people can ask what it means
Why not spelt out?
where's the J coming from?
What's the J for?
what cell are we naming?
will we have other cubes to trace after midnight?
Here it is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pPuXk1cglo&feature=youtu.be
Are we naming the J cell so that the J cell will no longer be called a J cell?
what does that mean?
It means I'm not entirely sure what we are doing but there will be things to map haha
So the  work isn't done, but the contest is over?
almost?
man I remember when IFLS crashed it
hah remember the video we made http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmXBZHpfnho
I can't imagine what it was like for your IT guys lol
I thought you didn't like videos?
amy countdown in chat so I know when to freeze!
@Echo: funny my friend just posted this on FB http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vqnSwTXAAc&feature=youtu.be
Did we win?
What????!!!!!!!
who won?
switch cells to what?
Thanks @Ketta, just figured out how to chat w/ you all a bit too late.
i got a cube too -- jamie are you able to play now?
Can someone confirm my group request?
@jaimie did you switch?
or the last?
Welcome to EA. Who wants to share? :D
do you find yourself not wanting to leave the computer... shunning family and friends when they talk to you?
Echo how long do we get the colored names for?
they are ours to keep for participating right?
I sent you an email about how many cubes I did the other day
you just want the one day?
how many cubes I did and how many were TB
wanna know what 8 straight hours of TBs were like
haha amy, practicing?
or when jaimie tb'd all day
haha, it;s fun when you are awake, but it's like you are trapped in eyewire hell when you are asleep
so I'm not the only one whose been dreaming of eyewire cubes at night?
if my chat doesn't show up will my work still count? (I had to re-log 3 times to make chat work)
my first one that I got when I came in was 1000
nearly shat myself how large and easy it was (I realize this statement can be made into a joke)
so now that the games r over r we considered part of the x team now? lol
probably?
where the hell do you work that you are so outnumbered by the female species?
where do u go?
you know an asian guy named Yuki? composition major?
lol! where does it mean that?
oh cool. He's japanese too. maybe that's what his name means.. hmm
who's your friend? I wanna creep yuki out now
word. how's he know him? (no i'm not stalkin ya, I just wanna freak my friend out haha. I went to HS w/him)
cool. is it ok to say you said hi?
lol i meant when I said "you" i meant him
sure why not haha
It is weird how small the world really is
By the way, what is your name? I want to tell Alex to say you said Hi to Yuki
man what a small world lol
i have to complete the whole bar t ogo to the next cube ?
abd what do i do when a place isn't clicked :/ ?
what do you mean "a place isn't clicked"? if it's empty but obviously part of the colored cell then click on it to color it in
what if i chart it wrong ?
where are the facebook/reddit/whatever cells?
did facebook won?
an u somewhere see the ready cells?
hey guys hows your day?
and you?
what time are you on?
facebook! has it been decided who has won yet?
How is everyone getting so many points?  The most I get is 50 for each one?
@echo Does work done now contribute further?
work done now won't contribute to the competition stats though, if that's what you mean
this cell looks so much more neat and organized than what we've been working on the last week
/msg GrimReaper Is there a GrimReaper available? :)
I thought it was a very close finish?
really?? but that doesn't mean cube count was close right?
/msg echo Do you want to check this cube out? Maybe? :D
/msg echo please?
?
that is also why I am curious at my 8 straight hours os TBing
still trying to figure out how to write this query
you were team FB?
Are you counting TBs over the course of the whole week?
that's what I'm writing now, but I can reduce the timeframe to any period
whaaaaat, I just got here and I'm already TBing?
are you in it now?
doing the same cube twice?
Soooo ... still no announcement?
Too much beer yesterday? :)
How did the neck-on-neck race end yesterday
?
(if not for merge errors and such you mean?)
Hm, how many active people were on the different teams?
Trying to get the TB-count, you mean? :D
Has the Harlem Shake video been recorded yet? :)
orlyrly?
hmm not sure. We can check with Jinseop when he gets here
how long did this contest run?
that's what I thought... my profile on here says I joined in January and I thought - there
my profile says "undefined NaN" for when I joined
@Echo or @Grim, care to glance at my cube and tell me what this is?
I cannot play anymore. What do I have to do?
what do you mean you can't play? I'm not having any problems
Why does loading the layers take so long time?
laure can I change your username to laure_bersig?
maybe I can reproduce, @laure do you mean there's no 3d pieces?
@echo, I keep getting scores when I try to skip a cube...that must be messing things up
so, the Neuron is named IFLS? :D
Amy, were we far behind FB?
where one still gets points?
by the way - shouldn't you enjoy your break?
oh, sry - stuff has also another meaning, right? English language, I will never get it...
like it doesnt jump sometimes?
it won't jump when I double click
how do they know what is cporrect and not
so do people like trailblazing now?
and in some weeks or months trailblazers are people with high accuracy? :)
seriously - you only get points from trailblazing when i finished my cube :D
say, when a cube has multiple branches that don't connect inside the cube, is it better to only fill out the part the AI gives you...
will the other pieces pop up as "different" cubes?
you want the caps?
should be set when you relog
so we do keep going?
The games are done aren't they so what are we mapping still?
what time midnight? CET?
it does if we ever want to know how brains work
what music do you guys crunch cubes to?

I love to listen to Opeth when i'm happy
@pinky: why? so they can depress you? lol
what did i say last?

has anyone heard of Interpol? (the band, that is)
how about some house from Austria?^^

did you saw the TED talk with Seung about this projekt?
amy, rprentki?
or GrimReaper? :)
Ah, it's dinner time in Massachusetts, right?
MN is... Minnesota?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P_AnvUIvJs
Anyone got any suggestions for accurately tracing a ganglion?
What does Trailblazing mean? That you did it fast, or you were the first?
How many people look at each cube?
depends how similar people work...
metal? oh, music
Did Amy say if she will return in the next hours? Or are they sleeping till monday? (Which I would totally understand)
what an egg-head
Haven't they heard of variant Creutzfeldt Jacob  disease?
not twice a day?
thank you so much!... so what's shakin on here today? (hopefully echo at some point) lol
what video?
ah from the team?
wasn't it conditional on how much work we got done today lol
hm... it is boring to tease echo, when he is not here :(
Amy, GrimReaper, rprentki? Anyone? :D
and what pieces of the cell are there have already been completely filled in by the AI as far as I can tell.
Where are the chatty people?
It's just 7:45 where I am
this game is only this?
2:47pm where I am
only this? ONLY *THIS*?
painting?
smalljude, have you ever listened to the Beatles?
why of course :)  I grew up pretending that Paul wrote that song for me ;)
except when team X comes and steals the lead... then it feels black ops lambykins lol
the dark side? do you have cookies? lol
what was the subject?
Hm, proper translation might be "efficient transmission of geometry data for WebGL-based visualization"?
that's the translated version? lol... sounds... interesting nkem
so...out of curiosity, what would team x have named it if you won?
nobody?
that's kind of what I was gathering, that a lot of team x folks were on board w/ the IFLS idea
Hello. How's everyone doing tonight?
I'm new to this, so we are basically coloring in all the neural networks? 
hey, any devs online?
Anybody know if Elise on here is Elise from IFLS?
Hey! How's it going?
'too much'? I just thought your team might want some insight
oh yeah i couldn't believe how quickly echo implemented that
hahaha i can't possibly pay him what he deserves
I thought it was a project that had already been started a while back when I saw it today o.O
Is there a way to find out what cube you're in? There's something pretty, and I want to know what it is.
no easy way...you have to know how to use the JavaScript console
Does it resemble J Cells #1 and #2?
Oh, will do ..those images are on the blog, aren't they?
doesn't it look similar to J #2?
what types?
Probably be designing the shirts today, see what I can come up with.
that's it? lol
that's how many you were truly the first person on
in some cases when the cube generator isnt running multiple people can trailblaze the same cube
ossomasticato, come fai a trailblazer un cubo?
hm so one slice for you doesn't show the blue?
should i stay in the cube? or skip it?
why have i never trailblazed a cube?
by the way... was it already mentioned who got the most trailblazers last week? :)
@nkem, try here http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.539675816052886.114178.378553375498465&type=3
refresh?
it is possible to finish a cell??
but it's not possible to know apriori how far we have to go
?
new feature?
last time i signed in was a few months ago. just wanted to check in on how the eyewire group was doing
Really? you mean it?
how'd the games go?
edwardio why were you trying to inject js in chat?
This there any word on when a colored cursor will be available?
And how about adding a second color so you can color the parts around the 'trail' you are following
not sure when
How are you doing echo? Catch up on sleep yet?
roughly how long does it take for the whole-cell to appear when you guys load eyewire?
irks me that that's what people get when they first come here
There are definitely situations, where a single quarter of a slice won't load - no matter how long I wait. But not today...
echo, this may not mean anything...but sometimes when I was really slow loading, if I grabbed the 3D image and wiggled it..
do points seem any less random?
what do you mean echo?
like...not making sense?
are there still a lot of cubes where you get 20 points and think "whyyyyy"
A little bit. I like what you did with the trailblazing. some cubes I really think I should habve gotten more points on.
maybe that's why this cell has grown so fast :P
even though I understand how cool it is to see a cube first and work on it, it's more fun now :)
What cell is everybody tracing in?
I'm done messing with the SAC for the moment. Trying to figure out where to go
I think J-cell 3 is where they want us to focus
SSL? 
what its the function of ssl?
So...you're getting ready to cause some trouble? :D
ok don't move on when you finish this cube
just do what you need to do^^
where is that stat?
did amy post it?
yeah, where's that?
yes, top 5 or so for each team, I'll post link when we refresh
waiting on laurcifer still right?
ok you let me know when you're done
so this cude... I'm going to lose my points if I hit refresh?
http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.539675816052886.114178.378553375498465&type=3
@Laurcifer, what do you mean?
you mean copy and past?
Ah, the photoalbum. I will check it out when I finish this cube
when 100s of 1000s of thesises all over the world take twice as long to write ... its this pages faukt
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doLpjZ13qBc
who are you in the vid?
?
Don't you hate when people notice that you're camera shy? 
who wants to be a guinea pig?
I like the 'unable to chat when muted!' message I got
so echo is the one in the corner drinking coffee?
I *think* so adelso (basing that on the other video he was in when IFLS crashed them the first time)
so...did y'all see this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doLpjZ13qBc
we've been playing 'where's echo'
@amy, does echo have an algorithm for "she's about to stop, give her the most interesting cube possible"?
ah, now I see what you were saying reb
sorry wasn't clear, seems like they've made it more addictive :) Coincidence?
troll?
when was this?
I meant the Harlem Shake video ;) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doLpjZ13qBc
oooh yah i saw that! Which one is echo anyway?
who holds up the laptop?
Sebastian's the one that cracks me up :) and Claire, in the foreground when they all start dancing
oh..who is that?
what inspired sebastians awesome moves?
Echo? oh echo?
favicon?
but there are some new values, like "1818864" and so on... what are those?
and why "-.-"
where?
i wanted to see what it looked like, but it's not showing up
the overview isnt?
Ketta, you purple? :)
what stats? there are accuracy stats now?
then why are you purple, Ketta?
@wtc ok where is it again?
ah... well... at least for some of the stats... you meant the facebook pictures?
Probably the error occurred where the branch runs 'through' the V shape, seems to 'connect' there.
oooh i think maybe I see what you mean
Wow ... wonder how that works ... :/
I've noticed that too. Seems the data is there, but not displayed (struggles between 2d and 3d), when wiggled, 
Threading issue? :)
no, but that's kinda what it is
still?
earlier = today?
that's why I like the "cubes added" statistics
Are you also annoyed by that high plane opacity? Or is it just me...
@nkem, did you lower it?
hey, may I ask something?
?
does it save other settings?
mute?
@ezkleber, the biggest problem I think eyewire has had is people missing branches, but I'm not sure how to answer
@nkem, better to not get points from skipping first?
Here's out blooper reel...but Echo is sitting right behind rachel!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYyf9eVechM&feature=youtu.be
@reb1618 for me, my biggest fear is to go and follow a false path. How bad would that be?
@ditto what nkem said, best is to be slow and careful and learn while you go!
@amy, did they kick you out of the 1st 15 sec of video b/c you couldn't stop laughing?
how did you know reb?
Hmmm, I'll just say it was obvious when we skyped :)
final video?
could you do that link again?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYyf9eVechM&feature=youtu.be
and could you give me such a stylish color? :)
Whose the guy standing on the chair?
@echo, skip or follow one?
how did you get the blue-violet color echo??
Sebastian takes the cake. Nice username echo! What color should i be!
@amy, they kicked you out of video b/c you couldn't stop laughing?
esp when no one else is dancing. 
i don't know how those ppl kept a straight face
Did you have the music playing in the room?
@amy, you up for some grim reaping?
@wtc I don't know how to grim reap -- im working on blog posts and a gazillion things
trying to figure out how to get echo into more videos... 
like a counter of how much coffee I've had?
@lambykins00 ... it 'jumps'?
oh yah, when i switch to the other view, it does more of a "jump" type effect when i scroll up and down
Still don't know when.
Did you change the orientation of your cube recently?
ALT+Drag, i mean?
oooh, speaking of, does anybody else sometimes get their 2d slices stuck in a diamond shape when they do the ALT-drag thing?
really? It happens to me maybe half the time that i do it
it's like the area that shows the 2d slides gets stuck in a position so that the corners are where the flat sides used to be, like a diamond
passed?
haha, you got it?
what do u do? just shake the 3d cube to help 2d slices load?
really? or are you guys punking me?
But the re-render should also apply by scrolling up and down, or not?
Great minds think alike... is this correct?
*drum roll*?
I can now detect how much of the basic mesh has loaded
uh oh what broke
ah, right - we get back to the cube nowadays, right?
am i?
where?
you were talking when amy was filming the how to view the IFLS neuron
you mean... writing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG2xX0nhNi8
typing writing you know what I mean
But it is good, everyone will think: "Wow, what was that about echos performance nkem was mentioning in this video? I have to look for it!"
sry, are you getting a message everytime I mention "echo"?
so...what about amy not being able to stop laughing?
did you see the bloopers video ketta?
Isn't the IP ban useless in most cases, anyways?
a loooong time ago when worked on a game fansite (worked = volunteered), I had one troll who knew how to do that, had the resources, whateve
do you guys navigate around the overview much?
only when looking for mergers
no. when i get back from overview the cube always spins wildly :D
Is this maybe from another game?
when I unlock this for you all, shift+click will select the cube at a point
and we can "inspect" those cubes?
what's the eta on that echo?
vacation?
do we get another programmer we can annoy during that time? :D
are you in seattle!? I'm moving to seattle!
you know who else lives the northwest?
that's what I hear
I had a girlfriend i was dating when those books came out... suddenly she was talking about how much she loves rain
you mean the glowing ones?
Port Angeles is where i grew up mostly, and there was a store there just for paraphenalia of that series
i can only imagine how many tweens flocked to Forks 
was the movie good?
anyone have a good band they can recommend? I need a change while I finish my last bit here!
did you guys see those Bad Lip Readings of twilight?
what type of music do u like
Interpol might be just what I need. Thanks!
How many books are those?
isn't it abit annoying that everybody dies in these books ?
what books? ice and fire?
I read book 10 (1 english book = 2 german books) and still don't know what might happen
but for what they've done...wowzers, I have to say...great job
you know they film almost all of that on location?
Yah, i mean it's not ALL bad, but the epic battle scenes are more what i am disappointed about
he's not anywhere near how I pictured him and his acting could improve
i was a little disappointed with how they cut the scene with those warlocks or whatever
yeah...I didn't like how they changed that
(can you tell I'm a drooling fan?)
I *did* like how they put Arya with Tywin---changed that part big time
I can't wait to see how they do the character for strong Belwas
I want to see how they do the House of Black and White
oh..careful? spoilers?
why NOT?
I cannot log in to my account at home on my Mac laptop. Has anyone else had similar problems?
Login via Facebook or "normal"?
maybe I should try a facebook login?
?
What happens? Nothing? Or an error message?
Can you check the Chrome console for other errors?
I'm nearly computer illiterate. Is that easy to do?
what should I see?
okay, I will check that. How do I set up a log in via facebook?
is that on the FAQ's?
Is echo on now?
I don't know what that means
wonder how bad that looks on a fast connection
does it seem to work ok?
and.. much faster yes?
Echo can I ask you a question?
are you perhaps using safari?
it won't let you log in?
when I enter my credentials it seems like the log in page is waiting for a response from the website
did you try checking the javascript console to see if any errors appeared?
I'm not sure how to do that
I will check that when I get home
If I see errors is it easy to fix?
is your e-mail on the website? 
What cell is up next after J cell 3?
Is echo still pink?
I remember this other "game" where you were to unfold/fold long protein chains... it was confusing.
but this is for science so that dictates what we're tracing
it's interesting how they have different 'personalities'
@andrew that''s exactly what we're doing with the starburst cell. 
hmmm.. is there to make another axis of reference for these cells? There are sometimes solid black blobs that are hard to distinguish if it 
oooooh, was that in tutorial? It looks like much of help!
Is anyone else getting terrible lag right now?
so i couldn't see the chat, but i saw on the news that mit is on lockdown!?
Hmm .. that branch is still there in the top left?
What happened?
Is it really part of this neuron?
??
what?
what's going on?
Hold on, is this real?
UK news is reporting story of armed person on MIT campus. But it seems it's uncomfirmed. ??? Not sure
hrm.. wonder if it was a false report? 
is anyone who's here on the chat at MIT now?
now you know why we're here
I had a cube where it crossed over lines into another branch six times lol
yeah...that's how merge errors often start
The 1 pointers?
this box thing kept bleeping and I didn't know and it was pretty mch scaring me shitless and now I know what it is so it's all good, guys
Anyone know if MIT got the all-clear yet?
For?
on which cells are you working on?
is it unexplored?
Nope. It's where they want us to focus for now
Anyone else's chat connection keep going in and out?
Is there chat here?
Did they post again?
how do you earn 1000 points??
First in a week? I've only had one EVER.
So/. Where is everyone from?
are there some instance where nothing can be done?
Sometimes there are cubes where nothing needs to be added
kk im getting a couple where it appears as the it is traveling just through the corner of the cube
Where's echo when you need him?
?*
reload page?
how did everyone find this site?
did it get named yet?
And this is why we get our own neuron:p
What is IFLS?
Oh. That's probably where I heard about it then
Honestly, who doesn't fucking love science?
Aren't the other ones already complete?
I was wondering... have they published any papers about the results of this project yet?
well, I'm not good at listening English-speaking people. That's why I asked for some papers :P
can someone link me the ted talk?
you can choose subtitels when you move on the video and the info pops up
Echo's here?
echo?
Loading bar?
Is he hiding under an alias?
When you load eyewire, it now shows a loading bar.
What kind of cell is that. :O
where do you see the cell mapped?
?
where is that "merge"?
I spotted it yesterday when it was still fresh. :)
well, but if a cube is done by many people, shouldn't it be deleted "automatically"?
sorry a question, I am new and am learning but i cont remember I like can play with the contrast??
is possible that the neuron makes some sort of "U"?
you can change the paint colour, if that helps you?
it looked odd, that's why I asked :)
I have seen them curl back on themselves, if that's what you mean
???
need help?
how do you get 58 or 79 points? i always  get 50
Depends how complicated the cube is
Are you still on the tutorial?
That's more structured so that is why you always get 50
What do I do if my cube has no blue at all?
what if the AI coloured a wrong thing?
When it doubt, I leave it out
When I try, I eat a fly
??
Today I was reminded how glad I am not to live in Portland anymore. Wheeee!
What's going on in portland>
yeah, it's not bad where I'm at now.
I'll be in heaven when I can move to a tiny town in BFE
Where I'm at in Nashville is perfect. It's a twenty minute walk from downtown, but it feels like its own little town here.
Haha I grew up in a Sourthern California desert so I think that's why I love sun lol
where we are now it's nice and quiet...so it's a nice change. Lots less traffic, no rush hour, etc.
When you trailblaze, does the retroactive points you get replace the 50 or get added on top of it?
yeah...I had thought maybe the 50 was taken out of what you would have gotten normally, but it's a full 50 point bonus
@andrewb nice.. which cell?
holy crap andrewb, going to bust the record?
andrewb you should be seeing the missing pixels when you close your eyes :)
@andrewb How many 1000s you got today? :)
and another 28k in 20s, right? :D
Ok tell me how it works:p
Go up to them, "Hey babe. How's it going. I'm the fastest finger clicker in eyewire." I'm sure it will work all the time:p
I wonder where all the devs are today.
hi all, forum down?
Is it still down?
btw, I'm kind of new to this, do any of you guys know what happens if you map a branch wrong?
hahah, I guess that's what the chat is for :)
Chat is so much fun when more people are on. Eyewire has some great conversations.
A quarter of the picture is missing... what do i do!?
how many hours is that?
where you guys from?
New Zealand... you?
nice.. where in Canada?
dude, what time is it in new zealand?
23rd or 24th?
hahhaha! So you're tomorow? :P
how do you trailblaze?
is that nearly 24 hours?
wooow... what sorcery is that? ;)
est-ce que qqun parle francais?
only 50k in 1 day? :)
Are we all working on the same cell?
me too..weekends are little scant when it comes to lab people
how's loading for you guys?
I've been gone a few days. How has everyone been doing? 
yourself?
18 unites?
lol when you said that during competition i almost had a breakdown at my computer viper 
so, all knowledgeable veterans, is simply practice the best way to improve? 
what does it mean when someone "trailblazed" a cube?
MLG?
Master Level Eye Wirer?
@Bocu, was he hacking? Or just being a total dick? XD
What do you for a living, out of curiosity, Buco?
?
What's option 2?
OK, NOW what's option 2?
hey guys what does it mean when someone trailblazes a cube?
still leaning how to spot those...though I have skipped some cubes because they're just bad :P
they probably were errors--couldn't do what I felt I should be able to w/ them
how is everyone today?
pretty good cade, yourself?
How long have you been on eyewire?
How are you liking it cade?
Just keep at it. You'll start to recognize what's right and what isn't over time.
Another accident.. fuck me.. right? :D
you been up all night, buco?
@ketta, look at cell again, are the mergers you saw black now?
@ketta, crazy that we can recognize neuron mergers? Pretty good for zoology and microbiology
I'm trying to learn to spot them, sometimes I don't know how people can see them
how come :D
cell body?
so you dont fill the details? ;)
Ar you working on the J-cell buco?
@buco, k :D  Where am I at?
Messy as hell, isn't it?
why not right?
the big fat thing in the middle?
ketta could you hold on for few weeks please? :D
hold out? I don't know what that means. :P
you never know what might happen...
what are the black parts?
93, 93 :D reb, how do you mark errors? :O
ah, ok! And how is possible that there are black parts followed by colored ones?
do you also know what happend to the blog/forum? :D
?
that's why blog and forum aren't working
ahhh, maybe that's why it's a bit slow too, thx
always something isn't it?
andrewb is here to show us all how to do it :) welcome back
aren't you all part of the lab too?
how many pts did andrewb get last night?
did that beat aafenton's record?
Do what?
We should have an all time high score. I had to use the picture on Facebook to see what everyone else had.
wait... who is echo? :)
I think I need to send the lab a nice box of homemade jam or something :P Everybody loves jam, right?
you make jam???
neuron jam? :D
Do you grow all the fruit too?
@buco, what are your total points?
catch my total points then...how long til 362k?
ossonmasticado... os son masticado... they are chewing?
So... chewing bone?
lol thanks ;) I'm taking over for Amy when she's at TEDActive - I'm a newbie to this
hey! hmm are you guys seeing the updated message of the day? 
Can the IM sound be turned off?
omg did buco just break andrewb's record?
what is the current user amount?
I was just wondering how many people are doing this..
Did you have a restful weekend?
how obnoxious
when did chat start messing up? do you remember?
buco if you are using chrome can you check what version
or anyone for that matter, what version of chrome?
can anyone check what version of chrome they are using
this is so weird. the web client is saying its connection was dropped, the server is saying the same thing. don't know where the problem is
hi echo, how're things?
people will have to refresh for it to work again unfortunately, which is probably why no one is on
it's nice in a way, people just tracing today...working?
in a way, but I miss it too - troubles w/ some servers/cores?
and it seems like the chat issues were related to that, but they didn't seem to show up on friday when I made the change
biostats?
dang that's what ketta and buco said too
I'm a microbiologist, 3 (?!?) months from PhD, microarrays, sequencing, 3D confocal microscopy
who wouda thunk? See ya and don't dream of cubes or CDN
hi i just started today, how do you get more points than 50 per cube? ive gotten 100does chat seem to be working OK today?
Did someone reset the J Cell #3?
whatcha mean reset?
How come almost everything crashed? Blog, Forum, Chat,...
DDoS by IFLS-Fans? :D
according to others it only became crappy yesterday, was that also your experience?
what seems to have broken chat was a change I made thursday
retro points?
are you saying that you aren't getting points?
that is a legitimate reason, I'm sorry if what I was saying sounded malicious, I'm just trying to help :)
And it's also a way to learn 'how good' have I been everyday: 5.000 in two, three or four hours. You know what I mean, mate. :)
engadin are you still not getting points?
sometimes I have trouble seeing the cube, do I just reload the page and lose all my progress? 
so everyone seems to agree that plane opacity is the only setting that doesn't persist?
is forum login via facebook broken?
@echo, are you there?
is the 3d model not rendering for anyone else?
my cube shows no 3d view, anything I can do about it?
maybe refresh the page? (current cube is lost)
by glitch you mean the "cut" trough the image?
is this j cell 3 nkem?
how'd you get the ID? :)
no further information necessary? :)
id is enough?
this particular issue is only when *no* meshes appear though
hm without 3d model its quite useless to play isnt it?
echo - which range could those IDs have?
I think we actually know what's wrong
Overview is broken?
tried lots of things w/ no luck, anyone else experiencing this?
is anyone else tracing J cell 3?
btw echo if you're still on...when I try to come to this site I get a message that says this site's certificate has expired (not sure what
is there a post about that?
is anyone else having issues loading the 3D view?
had a bunch of weird super-easy ones so i thought, what the heck. there's lots of trailblazing going on this afternoon.
I see 3D when I'm in my cube, but not in overview.  Should I skip the cube in this situation also?
anyone having prob's with there 3d pic not coming up?
skip the ones where the 3D doesn't show up
I'm not seeing any 3D .. anyone else?
yeah...jcell3 is having problmes. Just skip the cubes where the 3D isn't showing up
@jude is it working for you now?
hows TED?
yeah...how's the TED thing going?
My favorite was Erik Brynjolfsson who spoke about tech future where man+machine recolutionizes progress and innovation
I've heard of that Erik guy (not attempting his last name)...hasn't he done a TED before?
has the game been acting up?
I can't remember what echo said it was exactly, but he said jin-something was on it (can't remember their name)
ketta is it fast for you like during the games? .. or slower
amazing? it was crazy! :D
hi guys, is there an admin online?
hey, i have a bit of a problem when trying to play... my cubes show up empty
what cell are you in?
how do i know which cell it is?
are the blue tinted parts right on an edge or in a corner?
and when you get to the cubes where the 3D isn't showing up, echo said to skip those
yeah wierd.... even when i color in some light blue new regions, the 3d still shown nothing. thanks anyways guys
what is this 'early night' you speak of? I don't know what that means
j cell 4 is new right?
what? jcell 4?
yes, that is what is says to me too, but if you click on it it won't let you do any
I'm still a bit unsure what is left over from the Games
he told me what was wrong, but I don't remember all the techie stuff :P
cell 4 now working, teamX? :D
should we be on something specific?
how's your week been, btw? :)
good :)  gorgeous summer here in Wellington.  How about you?
what's the research?
I have a lot of evolution envy when it comes to birds ;)
oh, yeah..birds are what I want to study, and this professor teachers a dinosaur bio course that focuses on that
yeah I would be too!  Do you like being a mature age student?
no one gets my jokes most of the time, and only the professors know what I'm talking about w/ movies/tv
yeah... it's not really the best timing - many people haven't figured out what they're passionate about yet
is that organic chemistry?
I'm almost finished w/ the stuff I don't care so much about, more and more I get to take what I want
what are you working toward?
/msg smalljude Sorry, but before I forget: Is santa claus wearing sunglases and shorts in new zealand?
@nkem.. I have no idea how to send a private message!  Haha.. yeah in some pictures he is
why'd you have to stop working?
dhill23, are you doing JCell4?
and getting MY 1000 points all the time? :D
are you in j4 nkem?
It seems, echo turned of retro-points, hm? :(
I wonder what kind of ornithology program they have in NZ...
native bird == kiwi?
How is it going, zlateskii? :)
completely missing?
@nkem are you in j4?
a videocast?
its for when videos break bones.
i can haz mute?
how do you guys eyewire... with a mouse or tablet?
do you find it hard for all the little itsy bitsy precise stuff?  I did with a mouse  :P
only when the site is slow
I drag when there are a bunch of little ones
I am still not sure how to help zlateskii...
how do they know what kind of cell it is before we've mapped it?
ready for another advertisement? :D
how do you know?
is that on the forum?  to small to read on fb
is everybody looking for a better picture?
Or am I talking way too much?
what video?
didn't zlatenskii say he is going to make a video cast?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG2xX0nhNi8&feature=youtu.be
I don't really know what they were going to do
Why cant I see the 3D picture, I can only see the 2D slices
how did it go?
how's your day been?
anything new w/ eyewire? all the cells look funny, like no one is working on anything
guess that's what happens when the yellow people hide :P
Honestly, sometimes I think...why hasn't it been done more already? Social networking has been around for years, so it seems natural
do you guys do foldit?
oh.. how interesting!
Yep..I read that. Sometimes it helps if you don't go in w/ a preset thought of how things should go
How's everything btw, Sebastian?
erm... how did you find time for that.. hehe
so how soon will we see a mini-Sueng pic?
haha should we put her on the blog?
why not? :)
can you take much time off work?
when will we have the exam?
that's a huge step--smalljude and I were just talking about how neat it must be to head a project like this, that's taking off so well
but you wont't stop eyewire once you write the paper will you?
yes...I'm going to helping w/ a professor's and his grad student's paper, and OMG it's a lot of work (and it's nothing like what yours must
I'm getting a nice look at what grad school and beyond will be like :P
what time is it in NZ?
oh slightly personal question...is jamiexq male or female?
aren't a lot of top EyeWirers female?
poor dudes, they have no idea how much estrogen surrounds them sometiems :)
when jamiexq is high on the leaderboard, she is mentioned in the lab
you are telling the truth, right?
where are you Jamie?
ok, do either of you find the long thin spaghetti bits difficult at all?
sometimes I find the tiniest little split where it will look like there's a hole...
and with how I integrate it w/ homework etc, I'm happy with most anything
Any of you have to wait. like me, till the all the 2D slices are visible?
black path means: blocked by GrimReaper or another admin?
Any admins around?  My 2D window is being quirky now too
rotating the 3d view does not help?
everything = "Return to overview" -> "Start Playing"?
@Laurcifer, when I've had that problem, refreshing and choosing different cells worked in past
what's up scoob?
ooh.. did I?  oh.. hehe.. sorry
I was talking to my husband about considering NZ a future home, but I couldn't remember where you'd lived before.
Was it Australia?
wich cell are you doing?
oh? do tell!
got a whole string of what look like mergers in SAC#1  :(
Trailblazing earns you points now?
is anyone else getting the message the the security cert has expired?
letting us know what's going on, etc
a plethura (sp?) of tasks
boy or girl?
you are like, I need a coach? really?
hopefully tmrw when amy is back online
admin here?
lately? starting the last hours?
When that happens I quit for a few hours. Occured yesterday, day before, and other times
Which cell are we suppod=sed to de now ?
How's everyone!
Hm?
Couldn't handle my 20hour break? Hehe
oh?
what's supposed to be in upper left?
ah, saw that when I logged in a few minutes ago
so, eventually there will be figures to go with that panel?
are trailblazing retroactive points still working?
How do you trailblaze?
trailblazing is when you are the first person to work on a cube
you get 50 points for doing that, and later when other people do that same cube, you also get the points you would have normally gotten
echo, you said cubes were marked as "remove". Is that why most cells were almost empty some days ago? (now they are fine again) :)
rawr? :D
where are you?
what cell
repaint?
oh yeah, I see what you mean
I don't... can you explain more?
2d slice only loads when I force a WebGL Repaint
Oh, should I bring in an additional suggestion?
Would it be possible to load the quarter of a 2d-slice first, that contains the AI-painted part of the cell? :D
there are a lot of cases where the piece crosses octants though
what's that ketta?
did you refresh?
it's a white halo, right?
I have to admit - I don't even know, how the old one looked like...
so I'm still doing the same thing (moving it to a darker area when I lose it)
ketta - simply skip cell bodies or fill in the outline?
well, I'm going by what Sebastian asked, and that was to trace the outside only
anyone else working in jcell 4?
for how long?
did you work a lot on the cell body?
ok,  why has my pointer changed to a circle?
how do we get the arrow back?
makes it harder to see where you are clicking exactly
um...right now I don't think you can (I thought it was a cross shape?)
what's the difference between a light bulb and a pregnant woman?
To be the bad guy and steal first place at least temporarily, or not to be?
I try not to see myself as a 'bad guy' when I overtake...
how CAN you be a bad guy when you're tracking neurons!
ketta, what do you study?
classifications? well...if you're talking taxonomy, there are several
I don't care what anyone says, it's not a so ft science
what do you do now?
for people or habitats...?
Does anyone know/remember the single day record?
was the nkem?
How do we like the new cursor?
Is BSOD a noted issue? I don't see it in the forum.
What happened before?
Including your hardware and what you did before the BSOD. (Coloring a huge cell body while encoding a movie) :D Something like that ;)
I have to shut down everything else when I'm coloring a cell body
really? Is that enough?
undo?
or Ctrl+Y? not sure about american keyboard...
whats this about cell bodies? (sorry im new) ^_^
so do we just get a random cube each time?
kk, and so how does the prog know what i missed? i mean im guessing the reason were filling this in is cause the ai cant do it no?
are you still in the tutorial? with a progress bar?
seriously, are there any other games you know which is nerdier than this? 
why did this start beeping? 
As far as topology, can neurons form loops? I find this strange. I thought they were more dendritic
anyone else have problems with the 3d cube not loading right?
completely missing or just parts?
you can see the work of a specific person?
whats the point of this? 
does that mean you are one of the primary researchers?
what's your cut of the profit?
that's where I heard it too, I love this kind of stuff
is there mathematical modeling for error calculation or is it simple pattern recognition of various neuron types?
This is fascinating but I am not sure how long it will capture my interest.  Any of you been here a long time?
I was able to get up to 30what the benefits of trailblazing a cube?
what are
@ajffja do you mean the cubes you are working on now?
oh...perhaps there is a wizard out there somewhere.It would be cool to know how we compare to the experts,just for fun
within this game you get 50 points for doing that, and later when others have done the same cube you will earn points retroactively
when do people get paid?lol
i suppose you don't like smart alecs,huh echo?
What kind of connection is good for this?  The images seem to be loading slowly for me.
is it common to find a cube that seems 'complete' without having to add any color?
does it end in the middle of the cube or go across?
@eapeluso what's up?
are you in class now or is this homework?
and the teachers didn't silence the chat? MUAHAHAHA
Class? I'm just here because I'm interested
and cool!  you're in the tutorial eapeluso?
can anyone see me??!
Grim Reaper want to party?
I know you get this a lot but, are you the actual Grim Reaper?
reload necessary, echo?
so you made it?
are you going to kill me?
when two cells get stuck together
what is being killed?
obviously @grimreaper i don't know what i'm doing
where do you live?
watch what I add to the cube
what up girl!!
what cube
why are you only helping emilY? do you have a crush on her? @GrimReaper
ok, so you guys are having trouble seeing what to color?
whats your address grim reaper?
we just do not know how to play
May I ask, what subject this is, if your teacher told you to "eyewire"? :)
when do you fight the boss in here? 
Will you facebook me?
for everyone having trouble, check out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3UtT_Kr8Cw
this is a tutorial video that sh ows you how to play
who is canca? why is he so good?
are you a boy or a gril?
whats a gril?
i am quite sure to have a merger here. what do i have to do?
how old are you @grimreaper
I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have a
bigboy94 is liam neeson? :ooo
is it bad that i feel like i could do this all day long?
/msg GrimReaper Can I mute him? Pleeeaaaase :D
I can't see all the blue in the cube on the left.  I'm on the first tutorial.  Some of what's shown in the tutorial video & on the slice at 
@onex let me check what's going on
@onexused, what browser are you using?
/msh echo wtf is cool?
what's trailblazing?
I'm new what is going on?
so whats happening?
Or what I assume is the last.
How are you guys doing with the tutorial?
i finished it but am curious as to what i do now
@hhomer, you can't click on Move On?
shouldt i finish it first?
Does this mean: Only the border to other cells?
Or also the cube border?
/msg nkem to find where the cell body continues into the next cube we just need it to hit the edge of the cube (the bodies are huge, only 
whats woth a lot of points?
OK, but then, do we concentrate on the side of the cell AND the sides of the cube?
how large is the area within the cube?
each voxel is something like 20nm x 20nm x 40 nm, I think?
are there sections of the brain that we can choose to work on? such as the frontotemporal lobes?
ok. how many cubes are there in eyewire to work on?
did you click on a colored part, couc?
@couc does the plane move at all?
or on an "empty" spot?
@element on the J Cell # (which comes up when you log in) there are 1686
total we have thousands and thousands of cubes, if you hit change cell you can see how many cubes are up on our current cells
how do you get points for trailblazing what soes it mean?
And how come i got only 20 points for the last body?! :D
/msg nkem because everyone else was bad?
how do i use my special abilities?
/msg GrimReaper Can i submit?
@erik what os?
wait whats up?
is there no xp bonus for chain combos?
/msg GrimReaper Are you watching me again?! :D
/msg nkem hahaha yes, just wait till the new SAC levels come out, we'll see how well students do then
Is EyeWire presenting at the Unite for Sight Conference? http://www.uniteforsight.org/conference/
@echo, i'm not seeing the 3d model of the cube, have f5'd. other fix?
aaand you tried it? :D
Have you guys started working on the actual mapping?
any ideas?
pccarconsult, actually the tutorial is quite clear as to what the goal is
does this also apply for possible mergers?
where do we see the cube ID?
uh... forum crashed, too?
hit start playing pccar?
i have hit play and i have a cell 3 on the screen but i can only turn the cell what is my goal?
where do these images come from? 
apz1021, are you talking to me?
anyone explain how to play this game just heard about it on npr
apz1021, are you there?
How many of you folks are new to EyeWire today?
Mine came up on my flipboard - odd one out or what? :P
Err, any way to stop chat scrolling when I scroll to change layer?
I lost the progress bar in fill in the missing peices?
how do i get the list of users off my screen?
tried resizing window.  didnt help?
@wayward when all else fails, refresh :)
How do you do different types of cells? Like get different levels of points
how do i get this score list out of here?
Anyone else have an issue where the image isn't showing the color of the pre-done area? Like, I have entire blank levels on here
when there should clearly be something
what does trailblazed mean?
the score list is present while playing. i'm not talking about at the home page. not sure what happened but it popped up out of nowhere
oh the score list that pops up when you submit a cube?
Why do I suck so bad at this -_-
@skinny, don't worry, you'll get better, is there something specific you're having issues with?
Grim, are you someone who worked on making this?
help you guys when you get stuck, kill off mergers
I HATE when that happens! Lol
How come I always earn 50 points?
always?
Help .... doing tutorial ... no blue ... no blinking region .... using chrome ... any ideas?
adn you're not trailblazing?
I got a 100Ohh, how do you get off of practice ones?
OK, I got through the practice one.  Do some cubes not have 3d?
when you're done with them 
so you get more points once your done with practice ones?
how do you zoom in if you have no scroll>
the 3d is not loading.  Should I just get a new cube?
Haha yeah that's where I heard about it
That's how I heard about this, in any case.
that is what brought me here, heard about it on NPR this morning.
what key zooms on 3D
how does it know which pieces you missed? Wouldn't it just fill those in by itself?
Who wouldn't snatch such a wondrous opportunity?
for 12 of them (I think?) we don't give you any feedback during
Oh, but there's still training cubes after the tutorial? That makes sense
you should have seen us when IFLS posted us
@GrimReaper, I am assuming you're associated with the project?
I'm presuming the people with yellow names are mods?
I've got another one with no 3d.  I guess I'm just luck today, huh?
Where do we see the Cube ID?
Guess how many players have registered on EyeWire? 
curous, how many?
4k ? :p
how old is this anyways?
Are you getting the results you were looking for?
What is FARK?
hey you think us users can get a small cut of money for doing this??
Is there any way to turn the chat off?
how te heck do you play?
Ha i just checked out Fark -- love how our category is "strange"
I wasn't really paying attention but can I undo coloring?
where do you find the cube number?
why dont i have a 3d cube?
or is it just me?
did you type /debug?
on Chrome or Firefox?
how do i view the video?
tutorial video?  a link will pop up if you mess up enough, or the eyewire yourube channel
have to check it when i am on the other pc, the graphic card was ok
ah, still in the tutorial?
and there was never a 3d view?
I cannot unselect with the right click on a Mac. Any Ideas?
how do you do right click stuff on  a mac normally?
hmm, echo?
tried refreshing?
why wouldnt this site be safe?
@Grim, np. Also, have you seen mergers in OSGC#3 and possibly OSAC#1?
i know, that's why i set the exception
Does anybody know what applications this research is for?
Yeah thats why I am here
I knew is was optic neural mapping I just didn't know what the end means where
I read Seung's book Connectome so i was pretty excited when i heard about this
tin foil hat, anyone?
i just want to upload my brain to a spaceship and travel the galaxy.. is that too much to ask?
reading too much accelerando apz?
how do I turn this chat off; it's in the way
it's distracting even without the sound; anybody here talk to the devs? pls mention a chat hide button for the next update. Thanks!
has anyone ever mapped the neural net.... on weed?
that depends on what you mean.
was that "half baked" reference...twenty years later?
right clicking with a mac is a pain.  Suddenly areas began lighting up and when I tried to unclick them more lit up.  Irritating.
pc mac debate discussion hugh?  at least we don't have to worry about an evolution/creation argument braking out
i actually just typed speak and spell into google because i didnt know what it is and i dont think that would be in a dictionary
but would it really be "your" brain at that point?
This is more than irritating.  When I click, areas other than where I clicked are lighting up and it is very difficult to unhighlight them. 
I want to start this cell over. How?
are you in the tutorial?
theres a button when youre done with tutorial
How does the program know what I am in the second phase of the tutorial where my work is checked.
ok when i scroll to like halfway through the cube, theres a few layers where it will only show me a quarter of the picture
is it worth filling in gaps in the relatively big cells even though the edges are accurate? 
How many different cubes are there
well we did the J3 cell in one week ?
how are points calculated for each cube?
i think it depends on how accurate you work, how much you had to work and how many people did the cube before but not sure
It's funny what the AI misses sometimes.
@echo, ID 43192 supposed to be like this?
you mean half the screen blue?
you mean not fuzzy lines?
how bout them telepathic rats?
have anybody a good article about that? just read some short news about it
Is it possible to zoom in on the current slice?
Your partner's a rat?
no, but as a lady i wonder what you fellas experience and i'm sure thats mutual
Are the darker areas meant to be shaded in, too?
how many?
guys does this mean I can tell people I am a neurological analyst?
don't see why not
...the same thing?
acida... maybe your chat window was open?
aside from the short tutorial, are there expected shapes, junctions, etc that we should be looking for?  BTW, took me 2-3 cubes to realize
that I was sposed to be looking for areas where AI gapped.
or maybe I have no business mess in here.?
why dont my clicks do anything :(
NPR is American radio?
why do none of my slides look like the finished neurons on the main site?
that's what I thought!
Have you run into any giant masses?
you mean cell bodys?
So pretty much the missing pieces will blink?
Had this twice today. Maybe a request timeout?
Is my cube supposed to have color in it?  Mine is all gray. . . 
what does it mean to trailblaze a cube?
gliches in the matrix?
Chrome seems to be slower with flash games recently, I don't know why just try Firefox.
i'm on the last intro level... any ideas why when i click "check my work" it won't end?
It's webgl, isn't it?  Are there non-browser interpreters(?) for that?
if I want to go back and review how to do this again. How do I do that?
What?
ORLLY?
foshizzle?
?
wyd?
i hate it when u click and drag and light up everything
why not zoidberg?
what are you doing? is that okay?
I lacked 1Do u guys like this game?
Nope, I hate it, that's why I'm still playing...
big daddy j what if lady is a dude
luis likes?
alen is so ?
not much how about u?
i like??????chiken nuggets
Does Goldshire ring a bell for anyone?
yahhhhhh!!!! it DOES?!!!!!!!b
Is there a way to turn off chat?
What aare u listening too?
anyone else's page loading slowly?
how old r u
15 u?
and what was the feedback?
Are you doing this at school?
so this game was invented in WA statE?
?
Literally just spent an hour trying to figure out where these sounds were coming from...
ok?????
Do we know how points are calculated?
how much impact does this game actually make?
who are you?
what us your name?
age?
anyone ever get one that branches off then reconnects?
what's the point of spamming this
hello how are you
how do I get off this chat?
what are you doing:)
no not a nerd and you?
how much impact does this game make?
?????? ?? ? ????
Anyone know how ti fix my screen? a quarter of it looks like a checker board.
??
no?
how do I get rid of the chat?
how much impact does this game make?
strong results?
The chat is crap very distracting even when it is muted
so, dark blue is ai or other players?
so all results are compared to other peoples' result? so it's just a do-the-best-you-can thing?
these vary from body to body right?
occasionally you'll get one no one has done yet. has'nt happened to me yet, but that's what it said in the info.
yeah when you are the first one worked on a cube its called trailblazing
are these from mice eyes?
so each mouse eye system is unique right?
genom?
do u guys want to do this when your older
so we are working here to help to understand how a connectome is wired
is there a way to set shift to auto pulse a few times a second?
what do you mean?
i find myself pressing shift multiple times to get an idea of where it's marked and where it isn't
huh, so how does the chat work to send messages or do you mean on the forum?
ah so if I wanted to message him do I have to /echo or #echo or something along those lines?
someone called?
how do i close (and block) the score column which loads when I click "check my work"?  I can't proceed...
can two neurons with the same circumfrence and shape connect ?
did u catch my question anyone?
seems weird that 2 would be right next to each other you know?
you mean connect like that ?http://wiki.eyewire.org/en/Autapse
Are all of the ones that we do added to that big one on the home page?
Mrgolden now i don't no what you mean can you maybe post a screenshot?
Is this part of the eyewire website?
is there a way to turn the chat feature off?
How can I get color in the 3d view, that would help me out a lot
how can i send you this ploto
?
you mean you have a cube but no color in it?
you mean right side black and white slides and left side cube with nothing in it?
how old are you guys?
what do we get points for any way? just to keep track of how well we do or what?
Is there a way to zoom in on the 3D cube?
Wait a minute. How does it now how much we got right at the end?
If it knows whats right and wrong, whats the point of us doing it?
why all the different colored names just asking 
so are all the "check my work" cubes done already?
how do you trailblaze? 
traillblaze is when you're the first one to get the cube
What is the easiest cube? (non tutorial derp)
the ones where the AI was good
What are those?
are the cubes labeled? i don't see a tittle or anything
my two cents is taht's when the grey scales where consistent throughout the neurone
what about the final, as in #6
are you supposed to be able to see the colors in the cube too?
it does seem a bit arbitrary at times, what's connected and what's not
that's probably what i'm missing
plus it's really fluid when you go through each slide scrolling
lol, so how is this actually used in research? 
and how does one tell eyewire that you have work on a massive one
so what does blue mean?
blue as in your name or blue as in the color of your neuron?
the color of the neuron. is the blue just the starting block?
dark blue yes, what you add is light blue
Hey I just finished the tutorial what should the next cell I do be?
I' red and orange, and when my 7 year old daughter plays with me she wants pink and purple
what's a starburst
I have three blocks on the bottom: red "skip cube"; gold "start over"; & green "I'm finished".  Am I doing the work?  I need more training.
do some not need much added on?
how hard is it to do these
i a way?
I finished and submitted a cube. Nothing is popping up. Did I break it?
what does it mean "trailblazer a cube"?
meaning you are the first to do that cube?
I'm getting 20 points per cube.  Why so low?
when you get a wrong track of any of the branches, you can work a lot but you'll only get 20 points.
you see? I am good at wishing good luck!
patience, mate, 1000 points score will show up when you least expect it.
what do points mean?
did it come back engadin?
the points are incentive, and when there was this contest between the social networks it gave points to your team. might happen again latter
if i exit does it save where i was?
way to go architect.  How long have you been doing this?
it appears that the trolls have all left?
Trolls?
i'm curious how old most of the people doing this are
actual age or time spent here?
do the bodies ever connect in mutliple places? Like branch away and then loop back? Or is that how you know you are wrong?
What grade are you in?
man how the crap did I jsut earn 870?
It depends on how much you do I guess.
scoring is used to make it seem as if this were a game when in reality it is not
What does trail blaze mean?
I think for the solid cubes they mostly want you to click around the borders, no?
what do u use the points for
why dont i see the blue part in the 3d side
Hi?
can there be 2 strands that go in the same direction?
are they on top of eachother?
do they look distinctly  separate in 3D view?
architect - how long have you been doing this?
me?
have you been the high daily scorer often?
how long have you been doing this (archiect) oh mabye 3-39 years
me?
do you use heat map?
how are you today?
I'm pretty good, yourself?
busy is good though..if you like what you're doing (I hope)
Hey ketta - I'm new - 1st day.  Are you as good as architect?
This is day 1 for me, but do you guys end up dreaming about this game the way I do for tetris?
Anyone try any of the other games they mentioned like foldit?
I like how this game helps my firstworld guilt for loving games too much
kette you had around 7K in trailblazing from yesterday?!?
why does it make it easy?
so you can see the place where to click really easy
doesn't color help?
why?
sometimes the color covers the lines where things lie
and how is your name purple
what other teams are there
how do I turn the "chat" off?
how do you start getting points
Who keeps spamming the chat?
No one is spamming...?
Is it the messages that say "username got X points"?
Reload the page?
can you turn the chat off?
I'm not done with this cube. Will reloading keep my progress?
doesn't work?
strange, you are sure, you did not forget the "/"? :D
If not much is missed then the potential for points is low.  Now to figure out how I know before I start.
If I log out to make dinner and then log back in will I lose the work I have done on my current cube?
Seems like it would, doesn't it?
@culprit basically, yes..points based on how well you do compared to others, volume, and a little bit on time
you can hold the left click down, and it will work?
does this stuff really help anyone or just something for us to do??????
wheres my mail?!!?
talking of the 3 years-old... I'll be back when all are in bed
do u guys know what website i can listen to music at school cuz my school blocks everything
youtube? :p
@xxw have you tried soundcloud?
LOL! A boy?
My 10 year old has a hollow leg or something, dont know where she puts it all...
I feel like there's a problem with what this chat stream has become.
What do you mean?
when did we start talking about food???
Does anyone know if there's a way to see the cubes other people have finished?
Chuck Norris is so awesome that when he jumps in a pool, he doesn't get wet, the pool gets Chuck Noris... @Tmanteiga =)
Was he standing on a stool?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr_X10iYeP8
when little kids go to bed they check their closets for the boogie man. when the boogie an goes to bed he checks his closet for chuck noris
Egad!  What have I starstarted?!!!
how do you do that???
How do you earn 1000 points?
get through the training/tutorial and you start earning more when you fill in cubes on a real cell type
how.. i'm new
does this game really help scientists ?
how do I pan left/right/up/dwn on a mac?
TB?
What is trailblazing anyway?
?
How long do most people spend per cube?
But is it more like one minute? Ten minutes? Two hours?
how do I know if it is correct or not?
for cubes where only a little work is required, 30 seconds, a couple minutes...
I heard there may be another round of the games?
yep, that's why I went purple a few minutes after the last games ended :)
How do I change the color of my name? Is that part of teams?
nkem how did you do that private thing?
i need to write that down, I keep forgetting it when I need it :P
/msg nkem are you an eyewire dev?
OVER 9000!!?
hah. 10 minutes aint got nothin on how slow my school's computer goes on when you try and get to google
By the way, ketta - what do you think about the new cursor? :D
Does anyone know if we need a separate username to post in the forums? The one I use to log into the game doesn't seem to work.
not sure why it doesn't work for you (it logged me in the first time, I didnt' have to do it)
How do I turn off this chat?
it gets is the way?  Thanks
i missed what was said. i was working. aargh
echo, what is the next huge step, again?
the inspect cube thing?
i dont get what to do?
maxxam, you are stuck somewhere?
@mxxam have you done the tutorial yet?
/msg GrimReaper GrimReaper? Are you here somewhere?
Oh, sry - is 'darn' a bad word? I am not sure...
Actually, that was what i meant :D
ketta, how are you trailblazing every cube
What's trailblasing?
trailblazing is when you're the first one to work on a cube
whats with the different colored names?
and later when others do it, you'll get the points you would have normally gotten for doing it
@mrdance are you doing the tutorial?
Would you like to be blue? :D
or red, yellow, or aqua?
how does it know if we're right or not?
is there some some tool I can use to fill large areas at once?
? what is it
how do you zoom in
how do you zoom in
i love when that happens
why are these AI computers so dumb!?
interestng so I'm assuming when a picture looks like an H you've done something wrong yes?
really?
why can't they learn to color in the lines then
i dont even understand what im supposed to be doing???
are they using my brain as a computer?
are multiple people doing each cell (as a sort of check?)
@lengel, yep that's how they work out the points, too
does is make a difference if you correct your mistakes after you check your work?
robbed?
which cell are you on Ketta?
So how long do the people leading this project expect this to take?
do we get cake?
the cake is a lie, didn't you see the messages?
amy and I made neuron cookies when we launched - we'll make a cake soon :) 
SCIENCE! What has science ever done for me?
ketta, do you work for eyewire?
How do we know we are not messing this shez up
How do I get them to chck my work and earn points
so, are some of the neurons extremely small?
oh so whats a good score?
your score is based on how well you do based on others who've done that cube, volume you fill in, and a little bit on time
yep, plus more later for what you'd get for working it normally
how many of you found this through NPR? just curious
anyone here ever heard of the IB program?
yeah. you in it?
got a link?
yeah. im in it right now and I'm trying to figure out how much it actually affects you in college
you mean like how well it prepares you?
wow asangtani! what are you focusing on?
whats it mean to trailblaze a cube?
ketta, what are you studying?
Why don't I earn any points when I seem to be doing it all right?
hahaha!! rar?
scary, huh?
say, how may people are in high school here?
no one? i feel alone
If you're gonna go into crippling debt, you may as well learn something, y'know?
dead week is next week, so that's when the crunch time begins
I would love to have a backlit kb. how much was yours
why would you need a key board to blow any color? whats wrong with white?
blow?
whoops. i meant glow. did you know the informant's code name for watergate was deepthroat? i think their bsing me
seriously? thats awesome and sad
hey, deepthroat, is it clear? can i come in now?
hmmm is that what I'm tracing here?
at what point do we actually start to work on unknown cubes?
kittyandmittens, do you have an acount on youtube with cat videos?
so then how does it know whats percent correct I got if its never been done before?
There's a spot when it appears to end the tutorial, but it actually continues a little while longer
hey, furball, do you have a youtube acount with cat videos on it?
hey derp, do YOU have a youtube account with cat videos?
and do you have derp videos on there, Derpquit?
so am I helping SCIENCE?
do i win anything?
so i win nothing?
we do what we must because we can.
but if your alarm goes "off" when it actually turns on what happens if you turn it off when its already off
??????????? QUESTIONS I JUST DONT HAVE THE ANSWERS TO
why does gravity get heavier when girls take phots
how do i get 13k points
how long would that take
if i play will this chat disaper?
that means EVERYONE else out there sees this too?
any albert Einstein's out there?
every one that has the chat on sees what is said in the chat
i wonder what this game would be like drunk, lol
who wants my autograph?
why is your name in purple
so don't freak out when it starts over :P
like a long skinny noodly thing?
Is it a giant ball that takes up most of the space?
whoa, is Ketta a moderator? I'd best watch my words! I'd hate to get kicked out of this retina.
eh peeps. I just started. How long have you been there?
when do u trainblaze a cube?
you get dough?
trailblazing is when you're the first one to work a cube
biology high school or college? big difference
hey ketta. is there any way to leave the chat?
whats the average time you spend on a cube?
Hmmm I'm having a problem I think, only half of the layer image will load below a certain altitude. Any suggestions?
what's up with the huge cubes, you fill them in takes hours and only get 20
20 points usually means you went too far, doesn't it?
take a screen next time and punt it to echo maybe?
wonder how many points total for completion
what cells are the hardest
does that work here?
is there a way to zoom in and see more detail?
alt-f4 is so old.. does anyone ever fall for that anymore?
Alt-F4 was an old joke back when  Alt-F-IV was the command to close an abacus
But then again, 650 isnt to much when you think about it.
ya. i've gotten 1000 points on a couple where i hardly had to do anything, because it was one of the cells.. it filled most of the cube both
what are the points for, anyway? just so I can feel good about my contribution to science?
I really wish the 3D model would show where the neurons go in and out.it would make this so much more manageable.
how do u do that
what, remove the color? hold the shift key
can you zoom in on the 3D view? that would be handy.
scroll when over it.
everything in chat is posted 7 times for me. what can i do about this?
how do you know if you are trailblazing a cube?
and then how do you know?
then when other people do it, you earn points based on how much it would have been worth afterwards
when the AI does its job too well, it makes it boring.
when i go to work on a cell my name and the rank list goes off the screen to the right and it sticks over a little bit onto the 2d view and 
any idea what determines the number of points you get?
hm chat down again?
this is such an addicting game why is that
well say what you want i'm hooked
what does exactly trailblaizing mean ?
when you are the first one to solve the cube
it's when you finish a cube first
I have a complicated branch here, can someone look if I messed it up?
woah, this is a chat, too?
Is the GrimReaper here? :)
Or another brave expert who can help poor Nico?
right? :D
is an expert here now?
question is there a way of coloring with two different colors?
or wrather diferenchiate between two different lines?
I'm ready to click "Check my work".  Thatt opens a "score panel" down the center of the page and I cant close it or hit "move on".  Help?
Try refreshing the page?
refresh the page -- when you are still on the overview try resizing the window a bit
didn't open score page this time???  Moving on...
?
Gotta say, Who here came from sourcefed??
We do what we must, because we can.
what is this?
oh god i got terrified when i heard that
Sourcefed?
how do u play this
how do i turn this off?
quick question how do I remove the crosshairs around my cursor ?
WTF is a sourcefed?
why are there so many people talking .-.
HEY I JUST MET YOU!!?!
???
again i have two branches that touch eachother, why is that?
When a mummy and daddy neuron love each other very much ...
when not its also ok
Is there a way to see the work that has already been done?
Can I pause/suspend and return later?
says you can leave at anytime and start back up when you come back
Do I just log out?
So how does trailblazing work- do you have to have been playing for a set amount of days before you can start doing it or is it just random?
about that accuracy?  Do these get proof read>
That's good.  I have places where I think they go on, but I can't tell where.
I don't understand why humans are needed when they already have the correct answers...?
yea, then a little window pops up and says what How long does the tutorial last?
do they ever from circles?
i really need to know how this game works i mean just by looking at you guys makes me feel dumb 
What time does the scoreboard reset for a new day, like what timezone ?
So is the tutorial like a test to see who is fit for the task? ^^ :P
So who checks the work that everyone is doing? The human error must always be taken into consideration...
WhErE's TaVbRo At ?
how does one earn 1000 points?
when one thinks of what he is doing, one gets more points for doing things correct
what a wonderful work game.
why is it so bad?
geez, when did you guys start
when not working try to refresh the page
The 1000 points is when you work on the big bulb at the bottom
hmm normally it helps to refresh the page, do you play on a old pc? or whcih browser do you play on?
what bulb?
are the people in this chat all working on the same neuron?
i can't find the tutorials, any help?
new on the page?
you start automatically into the tutorials when you click start playing
what am i doing
When you start a new cube... how do you know what to click?
why am i not getting any points at all?
but how
but i dont know what gaps your talking about
What does it mean when a portion of the slice is checkered?
Don't tell me what I can't do!
It scared  the crap out of me at 3am when it blew up lolol
inorite?
Did most of you come from NPR?
NPR being the radio station?
WHen did this NPR stuff happen? Did my e-mail actually do something?
i'm not sure how i got here owo my friend linked me to it
Quick question: Is it better to mark too much or too little if I'm unsure on a section?
I'm guessing the more you play, the more "exploratory" spots you get?
Sourcefed? I've not heard of that!
cool to hear how you all discovered EyeWire!
now I've had one person tell me each... Can someone with the project aswer please?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2iLKa9mpx0
trailblazed? that sounds sexy
I'm about to watch this video now. Sourcefed has 761K subscribers?  AWESOME!
reducing the color opacity really helps too... perhaps it shouldn't be at 100it helps you see what's going on in 3D
i have no idea what i'm doing...
teureka> xt_hydra, try thinking of the 3d as a way of seeing how much of the shape exists above and below the plane so you know what's left 
really? where?
Is there any way to turn the chat volume off?
What are we actually doing? Like, what is the scientific purpose
?
so does it have a ton of people map the same area, then determine the 'correct' from that somehow?
@roblin mapping the 3D structure of neurons so we can understand how they wire together to process information
so are we doing this by hand for the project?
are they using this?
my question is, will it ever be finished?
am I the only one seeing creepy faces in the different layers? or is that just mental illness?
I can barely tell where there's supposed to be a line and where there isn't.....
/msg GrimReaper GrimReaper, are you there? :D
why are we so chatty all of the sudden
ok, so outside of the tutorial, if I get something wrong, it'll show up red in the cube, right?
so Amy I heard talk of another eyewire games? Could there be any validity to this?
What is the highest score on a single game you can get.  Anybody know?
how do I turn off the chat sound?
Is there a way to do it without turning off all sound?
i go off and do something else for a bit, then come back when i notice/remember
@amy: is it better to mark too much or too little when I'm in doubt?
whats the significance of changing the bandwidth and latency settings?
how does it evaluate what's correct?
how long until im looking at a cube nobody else has seen?
mm i have a bug where the neuron isn't in the cube
So many people and so many little mistakes that could be made,.. What then,??
I think that's why it's a 'game' 
This kind of reminds me of Olson Scott Card's Ender's Game series.  Anyone?
How so?
NO IDEA WHY I CAN'T SEE THE 3D SIDE
loading images takes ages here: too many people?
why are you yellow
Is there any way to go back and look at cubes I've done in the past to see if I ended up mapping it correctly compared to others?
so just wondering how are we helping if it knows when we're finished? doesn't that mean it's already mapped?
u r confirming what other ppl found
It only knows when you're finished during the tutorial
????
I just started this and have no clue how to play
do we not get points for trailblazing a cube?
@april you get a 50 point bonus then retroactive points when other people have mapped after you
so why can't robots or a computer program do this again?
any chance are we able to change our names?
amylee are you a moderator here?
you know of anyway to change our user name?  I think I just want to use my actual name
Who watches Sourcefed?
that's where I heard of this
How many people didn't find this from Sourcefed
auraseer where do you work?
Whats the general age range of people?
why are u listing numbers
Have any of you played foldit?
Are there any gamers working on this? My spouse and I have a little bet
any one know the game roblox?
does anyone know how to turn off the bleeping when someone says someting?
where be people from?
my internet is fine, any input?
they just confirmed server load is heavy right now, i believe?
can these cube slices be looked at from different sides?
@mrgolden1 yes, alt-click-drag, see "?" on lower right
is there anyway to just mute chat sounds? without muting the clicks?
anyone else working or have worked with the SETI@Home group?
>wiltker - no, what is it?
SETI is called BOINC?
please amy?
is there anyway to turn off the chat?
is anybody experiencing extremely slow image loading today?  like 5 minutes?
i was wondering what that was
when you say problem loading image are you talking about the checker board slices?
thats what brought me here
?
@amylee is there an explanation as to why the neurons are so "erratic" in shape?  Maybe that might give a clue to help better find them?
how do you refresh?
Whatcha mean by erratic? 
is it possible to get a cube that doesnt need any adding?
make you feel good?
werebear, do you play kol?
on kol? never heard of it
what is it?
Gah why am I so terrible at this
Exactly what just happened :/ 
i worked on one for like half hour and when i clicked 'i'm finished' it never got anywhere and i had to restart the browser
So what is the points system here? 
I get excited when I get over 50 pts lol 
btw: whose retina is this? human? rat? cat? ape?
is it comparable to human?
is it from one mouse or a composite of many?
are these MRI slices or what?
can u beat that?
that's how they did the Visible Human Project, but with an entire person.
what?! ty ketta
so this is how i spend my offdays
Argh, I'm getting a chessboard all over the place sometimes, what's wrong? ;<
what does trailblazing a cube mean?
This is how I spend my on days
anyone know why sometimes the layer turns into a checker board?
i dont know why
@ketta what does the purple font mean on your username
how long has this project been up for?
I'm curious how I'm being prevented from just randomly clicking on anything I want and finishing that?
do they take the best composite on lots of people working on the exact same cube?
well then I guess how is judging points...
If I'm going to be doing this I'm not doing it for "points" I want to do it to actually map neurons, if that's what we're supposed to do
for science?
this is what a confocal microscope does
From what I see you should always get points.  I don't even click on anything and I'll still get 10 or so points.
is there some frame work for how complex the neurons we're looking at are?
what do you mean?
can u zoom in the 2d view?
?
hey how can I know that I finished?
what do u mean a7
ok, Ketta, that's what I was getting at
I didn't want to be spending 2 hours on a cube when in essence if they wouldn't ever be big :-)
does anyone know how to reload a cube? bottom 20is there any way yo zoom the 2d view to get a better look at smaller areas?
@ketta.  thanks.  im now on to the cube..  do i still map 1 path at a time, or the whole cube?  bit confused about that
are you still in the tutorial?
hey ketta how do you hard reload tutorial?
do you have 3 buttons at the bottom (skip cube, start over, i'm finished)?
do different slides have different levels of difficulty and therefore, you get to earn more point for the the same percentage?
no one can answer that?
ketta, are you part of the project or have you just been here for so long?  :-)
@ketta, lots of trailblazing day before?
has anyone had problems with the colors not loading quickly when they switch different slices?
is it pretty common to get a cube where there is no coloring to do?
for some reason thats what I'm getting mostly 
That's the idea isn't it?
Thats how I got here
i understand how to play, but where does the learning come in?
learning? you're helping research, not learning
you mean how dose this teach you something?
Is this kind of like manual protein folding?
you'd be surprised how playing around with stuff that dosen't seem directed to learning actually helps you in the long run. 
Are these pathways ever hollow?
real learning dosen't actually happen like how school has taught. Don't get discuraged from the lack of instant gratification 
how am I helping research if the game knows what i did wrong
when you start playing 'for realsies' you're in the unknown cubes
It might also average everyone's scoring when someone works on the cube
don't worry ryderov, your work is checked against others who've done the same cube (and that's mainly how points are based)
has anyone gotten some that were just really small|?
is there any way to pan side to side when viewing the 3d cube?
how do you actually start to draw in the lines?
pc or mac?
Whos in?
how do you trailblaze a cube?
how do you know when you are trailblazing?
you get 50 points for doing that, and later when others work it, you get the normal points you'd have gotten also
I just submitted and nothing happened, any admins around?
sometimes it tells me how many points I got, but not my percentage.  Is it just being slow with that?  
But I mean percentage we got right or wrong.  Is that what you mean?
its just what i wanted
Is it just me or are the cubes after you get out of all the tut fuzzier?
Is it me or the 3D cube really unfriendly to handle?
is it normal to have 1 or 2 pixes not filled?  Ive come across some that no matter what I do, they wount fill  
and what are you guys having trouble with in 3D?
sometimes i want to rotate on uh.. z axis?
If it shows checkers, it's just lagging right?
why cant i do anything
Can we cash in our points?
Anyone else having trouble with moving the cube?
is there any way to zoom into the cube?
3D? yes
I keep hitting "I'm Finished" but nothing happens?  Timed out?  Too many errors?
Did it ask you to submit?
What is "trailblazed"
First part in a cube?
mine just said that most of what i did was wrong although the points clearly connect
how does it know if you are right or wrong?  does it just reference what other people have said and go with majority or what?
alt-click-drag, see ? icon on lower left
try alt drag. It will do what you want
question: we mark down the path of the neuron. who checks?
other people in here?
Don't the students check the computer?
I know how to move stuff around. I wish I could take the plane inside the box and change to a different orientation vis a vis the neuron
not sure how many or exactly how they work though
nivchek - you can't rotate the plane because of how the data is collected
just when i'm trying to get the little dibbles on the edges it would be easy to see if it is from the right strand or not.
Alternate slices? How do you do that?
how do you know if your accuracy is bad?
What we are really doing is teaching the AI to work better right?
I've wondered, if the computer can't do it with any sort of accuracy, then how can it tell how accurate we are?
Wow got 90@loripig by checking how others do the same cube
but the purpose of this project is to help the AI in getting better right?
yup. Although, does anyone ever get a cube they feel like they can't improve on?
anyone realize that this is the brain....solving problems in the brain?
When do the points appear.  I keep checking "check my work, and nothing happens!
cool...?
how
does 'trailblazed a cube" mean no one else has done that one before?
what should i do ?
it's also really fun to click random sections and see what they look like in 3d.
how exactly do i work this?
is that one easy? i like the star burst ones
any evolutionists on here, like really die-hard ones?
Is there a gallery where we can see completed sections?
I'd like somebody to tell me how this system evolved. 
seriously, how?
how did you guys find out about this? i found out from youtube...
i should get paid. Shouldn't you?
@mleibowitz I found out from my GT teacher when I had nothing to do. :)
Nation Pubilc F____?
how do i delete he red??
i kinda wanna know how many users they get because of sourcefed. lol
what will you name it?!
what answer nivchek?
how this neurological system I'm trying to decifer evolved.
you mean the neurons in the mouse retina we're tracing?
Thats how just about everything in the world is. Complex, that is.
Is there a reason some of my images are blank textures?
if a cube only has a small bit of blue neuron in it, do we need to search the entire cube?
so the eye evolved a whole bunch of times, right? That's friggin' amazing
and when you start studying animal behaviour and tie it in w/ evolution...it's crazy awesome
100 years?
maybe mooner means form the time we were but a single sprem cell?
All this 'you have points' stuff - how do you know if your point score is high or low?
It shows a rank when you finish each cube
and once you know how much a certain cube *should* give...you can compare it to that (after you've been playing for a while)
I don't care about others, I just want to know if I got a 50 score on a cube, what is the total I could have gotten?
it's awesome to see the AI work for you when you click on something new.  It slowly adds to the section as it goes up.
your score is based on how you do against others who've done the same cube
as far as I know it depends somehow on how much you added and it's volume
Are other people experiencing very slow response time?
so my cube just has a small bit of blue neuron showing. do i just look at that, or do i need to search the whole cube?
How to change the white cursor to another color? Help! :)
what is irreducible complexity?
and it claims what?
huh?
nothing could handle it? 
like, without this neuron, that neuron wouldn't work?
so they had to all exist at once?
_I_ don't understand it, so how could anyone but an omnipotent being?
that sounds like a problem. what really happened, in evolutionary terms?
i like seeing evryones point of veiw to how we alll got here
How to change cursor color?
how did this neuron get going without that one?
they aren't? why not?
qwerty7878 like what?  "thanks for connecting that arm, i missed it"
not when you have a room of people who have evolutionary education
The way I see it, the Big Bang happened when God said "Let there be light." And the waters were first, as land rose out of the oceans+
Then the first life was in the ocean and air, then on land, and God orchestrated all of evolution into what it is now. I mean, how could+
because what supplied that explosion? i dont know
i mean whould like to know what kind configurations neurons aren't "allowed " to have or probabbly woudn't have
jevanshine, you said two things contradicting. Which did you mean?
trying to understand how people think
assume its there because of the wind or the waves? Or would you think someone else wrote it?
what would you think?
someone left it there?  or it washed up?
It washed up, but what im saying is the world is incredibly complex and we have perfect conditions and I donbt think its just a concidence.
jev, if we evolved, wouldn't we evolve to fit the conditions that exist?
jevanshine, why do you think we live on the only planet that we know of that can support life?
perhaps there is a different kind of life? one that is based on methane instead of water, or siomethign
And so is human life. Do you assume human life just washed up, or that someone wrote it out and planned it? How the elements just so happen+
Did I just walk in to an evolution/creationism debate?
I'm proud of you creationist/intelligent design believers, as one myself, I've found I'm in a vast minority when I'm on the web
You pick the flower and the seeds fall else where to spread the species
All Im saying is I think science is the language of God and things like this are a good way to understand what happened. I believe in both.
are human beings special? Or are we the scourge of the earth?
By the way, is it unusual for 15 year olds to be more interested in neuroscience than whats going on on twitter? cuz this is fun
jevanshine, is it normal for a 12 year old to be enjoying this?
by special I mean do we have greater value than a squirrel or a whale or a panda?
how do you measure value?
yeah, one objection I have to evolution is if evolution is true, why did we gain sentience? Dolphins are similarly intelligent as chimps...
why aren't there sentient dolphins?
wait, what?
so am I allowed to decide which people have the most value and divert resources to them?
Fur for warmth, and ambergris is used in some stuff. not sure what though.
what if in doing so I effectively kill the less valued people?
what?
was the whole dolphin song that they included in the movie even in the book? I haven't seen either in awhile...
How does?.....never mind.
Decide what is important to you, that's the value
I know right?
i dont get how this helps science
is eyewire slow to load the images today or is it my internet connection?
ketta, do you know why there are so many?
how long have some of you been on here?
I noticed, they are very welcome, but why so many?
congrats, ketta - top wirer for the day,, right?
thats where i found out about it
How long has this site been up?
oh. my. gosh. why. is. it. all. turning. red. AHHHH!
I hate it when that happens.
wha language do deaf people think in?
North Korea?
wats trailblazed a cube mean?
i dont get what people mean by "i think in pictures"
brit, ever seen a Rossetta Stone program?
you know how if you hear coffee pot u see one in your head
i mean like... i cant tell what i think in. ha! i just think. i guess i think in words. but at the same time i can see it through the words.
but what if you think "i like pie" and then you dont actually see pie, but you KNOW that you know what it looks like...
yeah......wait what?
i dont know, how people think has always been a really fascinating thing that i just DONT understand.
a what?
wassat?
Is there a way to pan on the 3D image?
what does the check my work button do if there is no progress bar?
corrects me against who?
you should press it when you finish the cube
It essentially submits and gives you a percentage on how much you got right and wrong. it also colors the bits that were other neurons red.
and then it shows you what have you done correctly and where did you fail
How do you get it to let you trailblaze a cube?
what does it mean by points?
anyone figured out how to zoom if you have no scroll on your laptop?
lots of laptops have a feature where you can scroll if you slide your finger down the side of the touchpad
you don't know if you've been trailblazing one or if it was an "old" one when you finish the cube
anyone read "The Lost Symbol" by Dan Brown?
I know. I hate it when that happends.
Am I a failure?
I know right? It sucks!
points depend on the complexity of the cube and how well you do
i'm a little too excited aren't i?
change the cube when it happens
say i if you joined today. I want to see how many people are lagging this server.
swagyolo?
what?
anybody that always says "swag" or "yolo, right?" has swog. swog is the opposite of swag
Swagpocolypse yolo?
Lotsa chatter here. Aren't we supposed to be coloring nerve cells?
what happened to bitchin and fantastic
is anyone else getting cubes in which there's nothing left to do?
i know right?
trailblazing?
what's trailblazing?
<conscience> , are you high?
uhhh, what?
what are you talking about? did your fingers build a time-machine?
I'm just being silly, not sure what conscience is going on about :P
what is with you and your conscience?
I'm not sure what I'm going on about either...
how dod
how do you play this?
can some one explain me how am i helping
these are actual scans, so you are tracing the path of a neuron, therefore helping figure out how the brain works.
What am I supposed to do? I can't fu(king do this! I t can never end! Oh I figured it out.
What is it?
how do you turn off this streaming post?
I craving cookies now. Anyone else?
Can I have one, Kaylee?
the only thing that is annoying is how long it takes to recognize that you clicked finish.
But what kind ?
What happens if we screw up?
Didn't the game say that you would learn stuff? Well I'm not learning
why are we chatting about cookies on a neuron mapping website?
what does that means ketta
you're learning how to map neurons :) but seriously, there's a wiki and a blog w/ lots of info...
traillblzed cube?
and it all ties into what you're doing here
What
how do you get points?
Yeah, how?
okay, so at any point does the progress bar stop telling you red? 
Question mark?
is there a way to turn off the messages that pop up? I know i clicked on the wrong thing, do i have to acknowledge the message every time?
does it take a while for the images slices to load?
that's how you hum in typing.
@khadalen partially or fully colourblind? you can change the colours in the tool tab
any reason?
Does anyone on this site ever watch youtube?
Bad connection?
5 times, daryl?
it's probably trying to ask you if you want to make keys sticky (happens when you spaz the shift key)
spaz?
What's spaz?
"spaz" doesnt work, it has a completely different meaning when compared to "spam", but I know what you meant
.. what happened to it?
@red: no materr how nice you make the usage of the word "spaz" sound, it still has a negative connotation.
I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN EVEN KNOWWWW. it says: stay in lines
how do i lower the volume on this game
does it help having the sound or does it help?
so who is here from sourcefed?
what you guys think of the whole pds thing
what?
What?
how do you trailblaze?
you trailblaze when you get a new cube
WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i dont know where to color :(
thats what she said
?
what is going on with my chat box?
@ketta haha, do you ever run out of these science word plays?
my kneejerk response to that was, does science every stop? :)
A u, wanna hear a gold joke?
Question though, does anyone here have OCD?
diagnosed? no, but I think I'm mildly OCD
who told u???
What is ocd again? i forgot
In actuality, or you're just super organized?
@ketta what is your ocd like?
how did we get on this topic lol
so do u use a lot of velco??
haha velcro and ocd?
I freak the f*** out when someone messes up my sh**
@lpatrick just like I said above. Oh, and if other people mess up what I do, it makes me cranky (but less so when I have an outlet like this
reb do you have that on copy/paste?
is there any way to turn off the comments?
really...everything on his desk has to be velcroed? 
@ketta my gf is like that when she is cracking out on a  project
i like how i can take my time on this and not have a timelimit
hey, whats the best pickup line you know?
how do i know if i trailblazed something
yea, that perfectionism/ocd thing go hand in hand...im so much like that at times when i am tense or under deadlines
lol what?
what?
a new FAQ's section?
do you think people would check it?
how do i turn off the bell-tone for new posts?
has any one rage quitted this game yet?
wow, I did it 94if we are mapping the brain, then how can it check our work?>
at least that is what I would od
i wonder whose brain this is?
this is what?  Nano scale?
ketta, what if a cube needs no changes?
just say finished? or skip?
is that supposed to be mapped?
how long does this take you guys. for one cube?
okay how bouat a challenging cube
10 minutes?
how many points do you have?
just get what you can and move on 
It takes time to understand how to work everything, once you get the hang of it and you start to see the patterns I am sure you will get...
wats the AI?
thats what she said
thats what se said
how many hours do you need? my schools make us do 8
keep try things around where there might be something and see if it looks like it fits in the 3d view.
your scores..I mean, what you do is compared to what others do
what kind if 3d image looks like it fits?
Is trailblazing done on a random basis, or is there something specific one has to do?
how do you get to the menu thetawaves
fap?
i hate how you think you got every thing and miss so much
how has your intulectual experince been going so far friend
I hate how a quarter of the flat screen goes checker mode and obscures your view
I like games like this where you help science :D
Reddit or 4Chan?
?
????
?
?????????
?
sometimes i work 20' and give just 20 point !?
?
how do you earn points
is there a way to zoom in ?
is there a mod listening??
or a dev?
by that, I mean an Eyewire Developper?
what does each box represent?
hsseung, are you a developer for Eyewire?
what does each box represent?
or amyleerobinson?
now wrong paths and no points???
how are you doing new dad?
why is that?
What exactly are the different name colors for?
how would I get this suggestion to someone who might implement it?
isn't there a thread on the forum for suggestions?
what book are you talking about?
why do you need to mark nonconnected stuff?  not colored = not connected
btw, any eta on what you were talking about last week, the test for doing harder cubes?
think you're up to it ketta? ;)
if ketta and architect are not up to it, who would?
what?
is @architect really an architect?
I hope so... or it could be client sided. Which works better, Firefox or Chrome?
@nkem you're in europe?
wow, are you Sebastian Seung?
this is an awesome site. This is a perfect example of how the internet can do great things
yes! how can we use the internet to get smarter rather than dumber? that's the question
If it's weekly, wouldn't "EyeWire Weekly" sound better?
Is there a gallery of finished cubes that we can see?  I know of the overview but any zoomed in stuff?
see??
loose?
so are we helping the AI become better at identifying or is the purpose to just fix up problems and help map?
short-term goal is to understand how the J cell detects visual motion
how is this whole thing hosted? Is there a server setup on the MIT campus, or somewhere else?
@sandrider where are you located?
Too many of us on at once?
how many people are on now?
is the server at MIT?
Amy still around?
really? I must have missed it.
check your email when you have a chance (no hurry) :)
what?
its already there?
ifls, are you kidding? they're a great help
I don't know how she manages it by herself
ifls is one person?
/msg ketta what do you mean? Can I inspect a cube right now? Sorry, not sober any more :D
the ones you almost loose in their own cell walls?
Is there some sort of printable flyer that I can put up around campus?
Spread the word a bit more?
/msg nkem lol :) well, I hope you're having a good time. Your birthday?
good idea. maybe you could make one?
distribute it to the community?
do you guys have a graphic designer?
@ketta why wouldn't the prof like it? 
I can't see how it would be badly seen
didn't you get thousands new folks after the NPR broadcast?
why are the names of people different color?
Ketta, what cell are you on?
you talking about the overview sarabc or the 3D when tracing?
game of checkers anyone?
3d when tracing
chess?
ketta any news of the new tutorials and starburst cell?
Not sure exactly how that works, but I know that the biggest part of a scientists job is writing grant requests.
isn't that always the way? "I'm going to bed! Oooh, NOW you load...FINE. I'm staying up."
someone here working on the yellow/green range of colors? there's like a fantom cube being worked on just beside mine that I can see
I felt that the light blue was hard to follow when on the thin ends
Different colors?!? WOO HOOO I'ma change mine! Hiya Kitta
Hmmm how does one change the color of the parts that one adds? I have a slider for paint color only.
are you looking at a slice that has AI parts and your parts?
OH! well I had best get off my tuckus and add some then, no?
not sure if it's what I should do
tax report, that's what I should be doing
That's what I've been doing lol
I'm having a lot of trouble with the 3d elements not loading. Is it because NPR brought so many folks here that we're doomed?
Hey is there a place where you can see all the points you've earned? :0
If some of you heard about this through NPR's recent article, did you also hear about Foldit? 
yea i heard about it.  is it similiar?
what are u doin on foldit 
Did they say that people who can think in 3D are good with it? 
There's one where they held a piece of plastic in space and you can track the lines that spacedust caused
What's the name? 
can someone with more points tell me, are these cubes part of a larger model? Like, am I working on a tiny arm of a neuron or something
the cell you get to see when you get a new cube? tha'ts the neuron you're working on
how many cells?
when the game isn't so bogged down, you can see the big picture in the overview
don't want robot eyes? So cool
tried changing the color to something more pleasant? :)
you can do that?
what is trialblazing
where you fill in a cube that no one else has ever done before
no idea how to do it, though
how the balls did hwhitesell get 708 points
then why do I keep getting them? :P
was it Jesus?
do you like pie?
mouse pie? :)
How do you exit the tutorial?
I'm getting a lot of cubes that don't need anything done at all, and getting 19-20 points. Is this normal? It's kinda boring.
just starting out, the 3-d pane is not working. any suggestions?
lag??
what was that other eywire ppl were talking about
... off topic question, but anyone else here thanks to sourcefed? 
tee, you mean foldit? protein game
is the j for jerm?
like jermy?
haha whats that?
Is it?
who else is playing this because of source fed? lol
Because we're doing this solely for the scoreboard?
that's where I found out about this too!
are you guys getting paid to do this too?
What sort of cube gives you a 1000 points?
why am i not getting the where's the overview?
jo start paying and you return where you left off
maybe you do, i though when I came back it was a different cube.  I had just started it so maybe I just didn't recognize it.
lucia are you an mit scientist?
a couple times when I accidentally went back to the overview then back, it was the same cube, but on a different orientation
it comes back where you left off
So what if the scans were only taken 1 way, its just a matrix of pixels
you mean in 3d?
are there rewards for earning points?
I take it most of you played foldit too?
so the points are just to compare your work with others? 
what's foldit?
so who's folding protein now?
according to sourcefed that's still less time than how many hours a week the world plays video games
why do you think we're helping to train an algorithm to do it? :D
would take about 356 million people working round the clock to do this in a decade lol. Granted, that's what the algorithm is for 
ok here's what i don't get.  if they don't know the answer, then how do they give us points and show us the answer?
so if you get good enough at this, you start venturing into uncharted territory? 
after that, it's compared to what everyone else does - if everyone says the same thing, it's assumed 'correct'
So once you fill out a cube that's in uncharted territory, it probably gets sent to the pros to double check?
how do u know if it's  uncharted?
how "correct" can an average be though?
they probably calculated algorithms to decide how many times to finish each cube anyway
I wouldn't be surprised but score has more to do with not how correct you were but how much "work" you had to do.
score is a combination of accuracy and 'work' (how much you had to fill in), plus a little bit for time spent
about how many cubes do you have to do to start doing new stuff?
normal?
but how do they knooooow
Where you get corner pieces with 2 clicks and you're done
there is more than one game where everything is made up and the points are meaningless.
are we checking an algorithm or are we creating new data? 
what he said.
i understand we are viewing rat retinas, but what is causing this firing?
the ai they create will probably be mostly what the next game they make uses
yeah, what are they flashing? just a light?
a pic of another rat?
does your work automatically save? 
is this from an MRI or other medical scan?
aren't they the same?
a MRI is a form of medical scan?
thats what im doing right now
is this chatroom everybody on eyewire working on a cube? or are there multiple chatrooms?
why so much missing in the base
10 cubes in a row that don't need anything done to them is normal, right?
Of course if someone decides to tell me how to turn chat back on, I won't be able to see the instructions. I can't even see my own text. Hmm
it's random what you get. usually about 50 'boring boring boring little slice through corner of cube' then one 'ooh, fun!'
?
constant reference to the 3D map crucial huh?
so is what i am seeing a complete structure of what everyone has mapped so far?
what kind of rehab?
That's what it seems like.
Where are you studying at?
the overview is what's been mapped so far; each cube is just what the AI did.
I usually watch hockey while doing this. I know to look over at the game when the announcers voices get really excited.
it's like.. Watch TV.. or help advance science?
what department are you in?
The better you know your subjects, the more easily you can predict future behavior?
that awkward moment when there isn't anything new to add...
@ranshack You are... You didn't know?!
Oh that's nuts. 10@krupala what is tomorrow that you are procrastinating until 2am playing a game connecting neurons?
Sourcefed anyone?
digg is still a thing?
If sourcefed is responsible for the modelling of ocular neurons... What a strange thing haha
i don't often trailblaze cubes. but when i do, i blaze doobs :) :P
is there a way to report a possible error with the final "solutions" we get compared to?
for the tutorial?
You only get showed final solutions when you are in the tutorial.
?
are the results already there for unknown cubes?
i wonder when i will get the hang of it
that depends on how good i am
full job, family, for children, how about this?
College student, Normal social life, Paper to put off, How about this?
ah, remember those days when we used to count the number of references we had to cite?
And how many pages we HAD to type.
i remember those fun day when there wasnt any internet :)
Wh4t u say? lol
what a life
Was that as good for you as it was for me? XD
and the latter is what makes us real researchers 
crazy researchers? :)
I started when the overview was half the size if not less, it is now huge!
I hate it when you start double guessing yourself
That's why I love the long skinny ones.  You know whether you are right or wrong
When it comes to neurons, I love my spaghetti.
I see what you did there
Only when there is fire involved :p
What's the criterion for "Trailblazing" a cube?
how do you mean?
I meant when it comes up with, for instance "aafenton earned 129 points for trailblazing"
that's a new thing where after 2 people do that cube after me (or whoever trailblazed) we get retroactive points
I see :) I was wondering how you'd get points from a new cube...
Algu�m a� � brasileiro?
wouldn't it be weird if people started online dating here? :)
Isso � muito dif�cil, hein?
how long has this brain mapping thing been going on?
Is there a way to clear the drawing and start again?
I have no start over button..?
are you still in the tutorial?
How did you get 1000?
on which cell are you working on?
so what is everybody doin'?
im kind of curious as to how many mice we're actually mapping here...
mice*?
It's crazy, neh?
how big is the cube ?
in the spin-able cube.  Is there some more 3d view I'm missing?
on which cell are you working on?
boutons?
and never has.  Because it's never been anything more than an indicator of where I am up and down in the cube
@xeno can you see the whole-cell when you first come to the site?
then why do some work??
I had to reload the page in order to get it back to where I can continue.
@echo: just that block of text there?
ketta, do you live on this page?
what he said
are you a scientist echo?
what language is this written in?
hey can anyone answer something for me?
nice :) from NPR?
Right in line with what I was talking about in my english class on tuesday.
you can watch us live echo?
I want to be like you when I grow up.
btw the debug thing shows up now (more like how you intended, I think)
whatcha mean ketta?
where?
did it show up when you came to the site, or did you have to hit /debug for it to appear?
so, are you still a student, or is this your job now?
I know next to 0 as far as programming goes, but it's a piece of what I want to end up doing.
submit doesn't work?
should I wait?
just have to eyeball it from that point?
Hello again! How are you doing :)
a cell body, meotode?
huge part of the cube is blue?
 i am new to this.can you explain what this dose
how many tutorial levels are there?
nkem, how long does it take you to get through a cube, on average?
But there are cubes, where I spent 10 seconds (nothing to add)
and therefore some, where you can spend 15 minutes or so...
wow, an hour on one?
Why not do a cell body nkem?
why is your name purple nkem?
Hm... they didn't approve? :(
will it be possible to simply mark a cell body in future? Like a little box to tick.
so, echo, how would you classify yourself?
are you a programmer or a scientist or something in the middle? or something else entirely?
what are u talking about
a la HAL?
I don't know why I do a lot of things, I just do them :P
you have a degree in Physics, right?
BA, Masters, PhD?
from MIT?
do they hold demo parties over there?
how ? :s
question. i got a split nerve. What do I do
I thought, those blurry slices come from a too thin slice?
See this? echo is trying to mock me again: http://oi45.tinypic.com/2a0ampc.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/RqUVbhg.jpg?1  One of my strands looks like a face.
can anyone still not get to eyewire.org instead of play.eyewire.org?
???
@echo  what browser are you on?
are you the sole developer or do you have help?
so after completing the cell body outline, is it okay to submit?
But what happened to his video stuff? :D
Do people that have more points have their contributions weighted more vs people with fewer points?
And the accuracy is now determined by comparing to the staffs results?
What do they know?
"What do you do for work?" "I color in pretty pictures at all day in a web based video game."
When I tell my friends that, they are not interested :(
I watched the TED talk that Sebastian did. Or is Prof. Seung more appropriate?
What do you guys call him?
I really like those moments, when the 3d view is not fast enough to show my added parts...
It's like when you finished Solitaire
is there a command to list current players?
or at least player count?
doctor who ?
Did you just add this command now? :D
IRC... That means, we can "trout slap" someone? :-P
4 was definitely *not* what I meant...
wait is this the same cube qwerty?
Is it plausible that you could get a cube where nothing needs to be done?
echo, are you interested in cubes, where the double click doesn't work?
Is it possible to make it so you can deselect an area via the 3D view?
what does it mean to trailblaze a cube?
Is it at all possible to zoom in/out the 3D?
who is echo? part of MIT team?
is this a global chat?
go ahead, try what you're thinking
How does one the Eyewire that the cube just doesnot work out.
Umm... what?
Try a different cube?
new feature?
How big can the neurons get? Mine is huge :\nthe whole cube you mean?
I've got one where the dark blue is in a corner and I'm not finding anything to add.  Has anyone else had this?
Should we be erring on the side of being conservative?
tikidoc - How so, conservative? 
include?
I generally try to look for the final shape looking correct.... after a while, you get a feel for what they normally look like
Also depends on how many pieces the AI missed ;) Nothing to add -> no points
which cell you are working on?
How do i check what cube I'm on?
NKEM DID YOU GET ANY SLEEP LAST NIGHT?
how do you slap people with trout?
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW THE POINT SYSTEM WORKS?
WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF POINT WE GET AND WHATS THE MINIMUM?
MAXIMUM?
how the heck do you troll a site like this??
would anybody care to enlighten me as to the color code in chat?
other colors are a holdover from when we did a team competition
are you challenging me? :P
That's what I was thinking lol
hey echo, few terabytes delivered in the past week?
Purple ? :p
is there a way to go back into a cube and try to find the ones you missed without the help of the color coding?
that is a good question. How much data does this generate?
soo how do you know if your picking the right links ?
so what is this points system?
that's just how much data we're sending out
how are you guys storing it? as 3D models, or something more complex?
you know how you click a piece and it selects stuff
I assume the mapping/coordinate /segmentation files take up the most?
@polynikes, your work is compared to everyone else's, to decide what's actually correct. Just do your best!
how much compute power is behind the pattern detection software?
Why do you refer to it as an AI? is it more than just a pattern detection system?
whats her name? the AI system?
Siri ? :p
never know what might perform better...
why do I get squares everytime I scroll?
Whoa. Love it when I click on a teensy white spot and the filament suddenly triples in length AND looks awesomely correct. :)
is it cause my pc is slow?
@thinkbrown What are your system specs?
depends on what you have
im on my ninteenth tutorial? i must be doing real well
19th? are you sure about that number?
Did the mouse that all these cells come from have a name? 
what's the scale that these EM scans are at? 
The colored 3D image is not loading.  anyone else have this problem?
@lacemase Which cell are you in?
the one i'm on started with a tiny dot in the corner and when i filled it in the branch went across the whole cube
you can't submit?
can I file a feature request?
what do you mean rotate?
does alt+click+drag do what you want?
the 3d image moves right to left when you right click on it
how a rotate button on the bottom bar?
how do you call in a UAV?
is there still a desktop client for this?
is it a know issue that slices load partially?
when I forced it, all the 2d elements started not rendering
does anyone else get a lot of cubes with just the ends or the neuron crosses through just the corner of the cube?
but they're awesome when they come through
What do the colors of our names mean?
i see all green names, what colors do you see? lol
How does one join a team?
how do you trailblaze
what teams are there?
does this go back to the reddit v. facebook thing?
it is what it is
Do the teams still matter?
we're only 4 neurons in? 
I just took a look at how data is being transmitted for the heck of it
What did you find @thinkbrown ?
what is trailblazing? i don't see a description anywhere :(
architect, does that mean you don't have a pre-selected neuron to work on or just that when you finish it says good job you trailblazed?
echo challenges me to figure out how to change the color, I start digging
from what I'm seeing, it might be
so how u play this 
What color is mine ... O.o
what do you mean by dig
the site?
Has there been any thought to doing a client based eyewire?  i.e. a non-browser based version?
I'm just curious how this works
I wonder just how usefull this stuff will really be
can some one show me how to play this
Amy isn't that like an additional 10,000 this week alone?
That's what I thought, that's actually how I found out about it
an AI decides certain 3D clusters are conected when you click on a cluster you telling the AI that this cluster is attached to the other one
Does anybody know how to turn this chat off?
turn the chat off?!
what color am i now? :)
orange?
hmmm game freeze?
What other colors are there?
EA games?
Yeah, is anyone else having loading issues right now?
/team?
/team ?
so it's just shortening it to save bandwidth?
using RGBA that time?
How do I get the 2D image to load?
a new Internet? Nice
and what are the chances of me hitting 4096?
Is their anyway to know if one worked on J cell #3 before?
really?
WTF? it switched the orientation of the EM scans
Is anybody else here a nerdfighter?
?
a what?
(/*o*)?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyQi79aYfxU
What do you all think about naming the first citizen neuron. My 2 sisters are not impressed with facebook winning the rights to name it?
are they going to put new neurons up?
ok how do you know if what your working on is the end of a line?
I'm new here. After it checks my work, should I correct my mistakes?
I figure that's why they're letting 1000s of people work on it
why are you not a doctor?
what's the red team?
redit?
so how do you change the color of your name
/?
Nothing for stumble?
/msg echo Is it possible to setup a Sourcefed team?
what's gold team?
I want a team stumble!  Who do I petition to make that happen?
is green color names from team facebook like me?
how do I join a team?
how does one create a new team?
?
ah I see, is it opensource?
and proved how some friendly competition between social networks could be harnessed for collective good
some.....that true and their not even impressed with what the contest did for science
:?
@thinkbrown can you change your browser settings?
an M.D. may be an expert in their field but they may not understand what this technology can do for the world
how are points rewarded?
wouldnt accuracy just be how well it conforms to other ppl did the cube
This J cell 4 is it getting close to becoming a fully mapped out neuron?
I thought that was J cell 3  that finished this is cell 4 right? I a bit confussed
@volvelle you aren't painting the entire thing, are you? just trace the one shape
i love how some cubes, i will get like 23 points then some i will get 400
I thought our goal was to complete the missing parts of the cube?
what do you mean by that?
dont know what that is
how i play this? ._.
If I am trying to fill my cube quickly it asks me if I want to "kill pages"?
did you take the training?
if you're in training, then the shape you draw should all be green when you finish the elvel
My cube is all red when I finish, except the blue part.
So, if they are red does that mean they are mapped or not?
click on your screen. do they remain red?
OK, because they are already mapped?
It looks like all the hay strands are mapped, except the one I am supposed to do? or?
volvelle are you using chrome?
How do you get 3d
volvelle?
I have no idea what you're saying
I know what he is saying
lain thats not what he is talking about
settings, color?
did you not just go through 6 lvls to learn how to do it?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6ENAPXN9Lc
you can... click on the bar, where you are typing text
what is this, the 90s
I mean, when you're doing a cube, there's a certain number of slices and every slice loads in 1/4th panel at a time
So you could just (panels complete)/(panels loading)*100= how much of your cube is loaded
why is this loading taking forever?
How do you know how many people are online?
I've finished the cube but it won't give me results. Can I just close it?
Any other useful commands?
does this load faster on chrome or safari?
it helps me when I click the button, wait, and the "completed" music appears
what does trailblaze mean?
Does this guy have a nickname around here?
who?
ahh, but he only needs one right?
Oh, is it the retina? My bad
And that's why this hasn't already been done
Only 136?  Muked that one up, too
yeah, that's about what my latest run has been
that's what it feels like
what would be the plural of retina? retinae?
Really?  I need to have a word with my optometrist then
 retina (pron.: /?r?t?n?/ ret-nuh, pl. retinae, pron.: /?r?tini?/; from Latin r?te, meaning "net")
really? hmm
huh?
touchdown ? 
yeah, but what about the hike part?
Post a feature request in the forum?
how do you stop the leader board from coming up after every cube?
the leaderboard is an essential part of knowing that your cube has been accepted, is there a problem with it?
just wondering, is anyone else here cuz of sorcefed?
told sourcefed?
NPR is what got me addicted
years old?
ah, I see. 4 hours?
put it this way, I'm at the age where I just applied to MIT :P
what do you think you might want to go into vevmx3?
not a mailman?
I have people look at me and ask...so, what did you want to grow up to be? yes, I'm old
for what pengwah
is there a school i can go to for underwater basket weaving and race car driving?
how the nuts did you get 720 points?
frak really?
why are you orange
i havent gotten any points...and idk why i havent
so does orange mean you work with eye wire?
what do you mean? I thought I was! :D
so this acctually help neurologists?
lol....then how do they know if i get stuff right or wrong?
maybe it's actually a psychological experiment to see how long people will do menial tasks when led to believe it is for a monumental purpos
1000 points? how?
why do i do the same cube other people have done?
By having lots of people do the same thing and comparing the results is how they figure out what's right and wrong, and I'm assuming 
that's also how points are rewarded
That's pretty much how they were able to make the tutorial cubes
how in the what of who did sandyilfs2 get 13k points?
i get it haha what percent of the briain have they mapped so far?
so you use performance enhancing drugs too architect????
and now you know why the AI can't do it
hello?
Is it normal to get a cube where you don't see anything to do?
how does the computer know its correct after the tutorial
ohhh,,,, so do we get to go to actuall mew ones?
the AI takes a composite of everyone's answers, from what I understand
soo... i have finsihed the tutorial, now i am mapping presolved neurons?
So, if it's still telling me how much I got right, I'm still practicing? Is that right?
it's neuro science how the brain function
true and that;s why we are here gamers etc.
so theses are scans of single eye nerves?
and each of these nerves communicate with some bu not others?
Where the ends meet
so when several players "disagree" who or what arbitrates?
Just started playing this game. Does it get harder as it progresses? 
if you get a cube with a tiny piece of blue in the corner, should you just press finish or skip?
How will this help scientist, if we play this game? 
so i suppose this whole neuron is a few millimeters long?
how old is every one here?
Segment why you no submit
so are some of these structures blood cells and the like.. there are not all nerves are they?
what do the points do?
thats why they annouce this for gamers for the hours we have
Did J#4 decrease in size? This seems like a brand new piece with the same name.
What happened to J Cell #4? it shrank!
Maybe it's a new J#4?
@klamp oh man I wanna do that. Do you mean like the block fills the whole cube? Sounds awesome to me
tomgowen, if you look at the 3d model you can see "rough patches" where there are bits missing
compared to what I was doing earlier, this is more fun :D
and what were you doing earlier?
what the lag
im on the bouton starburst?
ok?
you guys got any tips?
for normal painting?
how do you trailblaze something?
it's when you're the first person to work on a cube, you don't know until you've done it
so you can't say that you want to trailblaze a cube?
is it really influenced by accuracy?
how long does this usually take for you guys?
a single cube? between 1min-5min I guess
to get through the tutorial or what?
thought we were supposed to skip cell body cubes?
it's not really a timed event. The big deal is how accurate you can average per cube
they want use to skip certain cubes?
anyway to see our accuracy?
"the general outline is more important than the little bits of dust you're adding" is what I think it said
how do you check which cube you are doing?
Hm? you can know what cell you're in but not what cube you're doing
when we asked for it
what determines how many points you get/
?
When I submit this one I'm pretty sure I'll be up there.
accuracy and how much you have to do mostly, time is a small part
how do i do this
methos, you get a cell body cube? make sure the outline of the thing is all filled in, but it's too difficult to fill in all the small bits
should i just skip or do the little parts?
what's up sdsatish?
if the system can correct the work I have done doesn't that mean it already knows what is right and what is wrong?
if your work is showing up in green and red when you're done, then the stuff you're working on is mapped, yes
It doesn't tell you what is right or wrong when you are doing it for real.
when you get into the real stuff, the UI changes. There's "skip cube", "start over", and "I'm finished"
so u can get points doing tutorial?
Anyone having trouble with the 3D displaying anything?
i would like to go through the tutorials again. how can i do that?
Each cube is done multiple times by different people and the computer algorithm picks what would make sense and is right.
do they distribute the load of rendering everything?
there's no way to make the lines in the picture darker right?
why redo tutorial/?
Hadn't realized just how much I use it
Yeah, what's up with that?
just to be sure - there are people, who get a 3d view right now?
 It's super lagy. Are there too many people using the system? I keep getting "unresponsive page messages."
Mine started out that way, but even when I filled stuff in, nothing rendered in the 3D view
only for those cubes, where the 3d is completely missing
What do we do with the cube ID once we have it?
where is the number?
did you type "/debug" here?
tikidoc, you found the number?
did you type "/debug" here?
are you coloring a cell body?
was J#4 trimmed?
why skip them? 
Cut edges too, or just edges of the cell?
brutal.  But internet points?
I thought you were more conserned with us teaching your AI how to think.
or why couldn't there be a box you could drag across and any points in the box counts as a click.
?
you can see along what would be the 'wall' little white/grey bits that aren't filled in sometimes
since you can't... um... pan?
How do you zoom in on the 2D?
umm how do you zoom in to the 2d witout zooming into just the center?
in pdf-speak it's "when you use the grabby hand thing to drag your document around the screen to see better"
I think it depends on where you center the cursor
how do you know the id number?
we always have enough data to rebuild what we had
Are those missing 3d views related?
I have a very large cube to finish.  I get a "non-responsive page" message! When I refresh, i end up at home page and loose the task! why???
is a body one of these really big ones?
/msg nkem your forum message is why I signed on chat :)
but what if we want to do the inside?
I guess, you are already using Chrome?
no atm I'm using fox should I use crome?
oh?
??
/me 80 points please?
what is causing that
oh, so its the evil word "points"? :D
how do you slap someone witha fish?
5000 and I thought 100 was big?
I love/hate how another cube pops up as soon as you finish the last one. "just one more....just one more..."
ever see the movie Hidi?
and when I say kinda I mean for a g rated movie it gave me nightmares as a child
whats the pointof us doingthis if the Ai knows whats wrong and whats rIght?
I aparently missed that part of the chat why would the AI lie to me
is it worth it do the cube that's mostly filled in?
New cell?
ketta, why is your name purple?
it's left over from when we had a competition a few weeks ago
ketta=she?
new command?
clowns?
how did you do that shibadqawdwea
WHY THANK YOU. 
did you finish the rest of the retina vilo?
?????
what do you mean
?
how long has it been since you hit submit?
any luck?
what is that
sorry college, really sounds like a refresh is what's going to fix it
we spent the first 5 or 6 weeks learning what an argument was.
with complex intervals?
Is GrimReaper paying attention?
it is more trying to understand how to manipulate and nth dimensional function
what's the matter jarlsman?
are you a redditor, vilo?
BTW how did you know I loved math so?
how did you know my name
what am i thinking
what
guess i'll find out when i hit complete
do you have 3 buttons at the bottom of the screen?
I just did a whole cell body and only got 20 points...I keep getting low scores like that when I'm definitely not do that bad.
what difference does it make?
?? I started a new cube and there's the AI blob and a bunch of "you added these chunks" blobs
Also, why is your name red?
fact checking chunk? Get multiple people to collaborate on one cube.
Green is actually my favorite color so no worries, just wondering what each color meant 
right click?
good morning all. Any talkers on?
is somebody of the team on?
what's an AI merger?
a merger is when some player merged 2 neurons into one
an AI- merger is when its done by the AI of the game
on which cell are you working, beatrix?
Can someone explain the best way to control the transition between the overview and the 3d view? 
part of it is we don't actually want you to use the overview to choose what to do in the cube
if you do that, you are likely trying to replicate what others have done
why is it that I keep getting pieces where there is one part of an axon started in my cube that I can finish
but there are others in the overview in that same cube I can't see?
okay but when you get a cube with multiple points of entry it seems warrented to switch between views in order not to miss info before submi
ahhh, so, i should let go....and just do the one?
not sure what that feature is...
echo: how is it that you would loose hierarchy info by correctly connecting multiple nodes?
echo, a suggestion if I may: maybe instead of asksing "are you done with this cube, ask instead are you done with this "branch?"
that seem okay, but then why provide the "Return to overview feature"?
my learning style prefers the big picture. I sit where ever I can see most...
certain kinds of approaches to solving a problem?
I ran the test at webgl-bench and i got this: caps/MAX_VARYING_VECTORS 8. Is there a way for me to do something so I can see the 3D figure?
is there anyone from MIT or eyewire there?
I ran the test at webgl-bench and i got this: caps/MAX_VARYING_VECTORS 8. Is there a way for me to do something so I can see the 3D figure?
how do I do that?
what browser are you using
are you on a mac?
Your browser?
should be working right?
idk how it is drawn
wow, what a good looking neuron
Why won't my cube submit it's score?
where i am there's an error
Is this based on mapping already done by experts, or is it an amalgamation of what all the gamers think there is? 
what do i have to do?
How does it know we've missed pieces then?
Mmmm....it said I finished the tutorial?
Well obviously you haven't if its still telling you what's right and wrong.
Not right and wrong, just missed vs not missed?
is someone talking to me?
Is it possible that the excess piece is there because the branch continues on into another cube?
Is it entirely colored in or just a little shaded?
as compared to?
320!?
ya idk how ppl get so many points
I have no idea how score is calculated. I hit 700 on something I thought should've been about 100.
What if the people with more exp playing get tougher levels and thus higher score?
How do they know it's a tougher level if nobody has ever mapped this before?
That's what trailblazing it is, right?
Might be based on the type of cell you're mapping?
You get 50 pts for trailblazing, then retroactive points when the next 2 map the cube
hi nkem, how's it going?
holidays?
well... semester break... don't know, what it is called
oh, got ya. forgot, what are you studying?
biostats... is that... MATH?!
just for you?
@adelso, my samples from my experiment...is that your question?
Im not a nuerologist so after the tutorial how will i know if im on the right track.
you get a feel for it, how many points vs. how much you filled in
So the only way to know if your actually doing it right... is if your points are highish?
Accuracy bar helps?
so no new starburst yet?
So just practice and hope you get it right?
Focus on how you would have been able to tell they were connected if you miss pieces. 
can you go back and re-take the training?
And if you got extras figure out why you thought it was connected when it wasn't. 
reb did nkem show you the new chat functions?
which ones?
who is teamx?
So is there a team z?
1 million?!
1 million? Geez...I'm working on hitting 500k
/msg jamiexq private messaging? Cool
/msg jamiexq how can you type it like that?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC4Y6iV6nqM
What is?
what exactly do you mean?
I think, I still don't understand. You are sure, ALT+Drag on 2d slices doesn't help? :D
ok?
the trace goes out on the 2d plane next to where   the trance enter
almost close to where the x/y diverge
get the idea now?
Can the game show me what ive missed?
Well then how does it tell me im wrong?
it doesn't explicitly know what's right and wrong
why do i get points in the tutorial?
Motivation? :)
how about no?
I just now realised how dependant i was to the game telling me when im doing something wrong.
What do you teach?
who is echo?
the top dog? :)
what does our god look like?
GrimReaper... heeeeelp :D How should I become more accurate, If I never will know how this cube actually should look like? :(
so we're making what you want
and see what the experts found
That's why you don't fill in those stuff pixel by pixel, but larger parts with one click :D
@nkem, did you see the Reaper marked part of OSGC#3 to remove?
that was part of the bad merger a while ago, correct?
umm can two nodes ur buttons or ends of dendrites meet?
/msg GrimReaper Are you there? :)
-_- it keeps crashing when I try to use shift at the wrong time.
Purple?
*has?
then y be a hater? jebus was all about the love
why 
didn't I say that last night?
how do you know the cell number
what echo said
Wait...we can talk to the scientists right here?
yeah you think that theywouldn't be here moderating?
In the settings what would happen if I set the bandwidth and the latency to low?
what are you studying vilo?
yeah I have my ideas about how we should actually teach math.  like stop the lecturing and add more discovery
Kinda like how Walter Lewin with Physics at MIT
How far into completion is eyewire?
what type of math do you intend on teaching?
then I wish to teach other teachers how to do it once I can prove my methods 
have you read "The Language of Mathematics"?
Has there been an estimation on how long it will take to finish this?
Oh, we're only working on the retina right now aren't we?  Well I'm sure by the time this is finished the AI will be better and we'll get
Book is all about how to think mathematically not just learning equations and rules etc
How are we even sure everyone's brain is wired the same?
so we're working on one brain?
mathematically thinking would mean: "One guy has to enter the room and it will be empty", right? :-P
there are some similarities as to the general shape and where things are processed
and ultimately trying to find out how they're connected...the 'connectome'
What if the mouse that was chosen for this "experiment" was actually not a normal mouse?
Was it a mouse?
in regards to time, do we earn more points the longer a cube takes us to do or the faster we complete one?
they would still perceive directional stimuli?
Ok, then: What if this specific mouse does not? :D
either way Ray we will learn more about how to not only map the individual cells but how those conections are made
Euler-Day?
first pi day @ OSU for me, I guess I should see what they're going to do :P
at what average point range should I say, ok I'm not good at this?

what
?
I'm not sure why I'm not making those kinds of points on cubes, I keep getting 20 points on cubes that barely have anything to add
i know what you mean april
is it completely random or is there an xp system where higher scoring cubes go to people with consistently more points?
how do you know that you made the correct path here?
After we finish all this in god-knows-how-long, We'll all sing "Still Alive"

hey april what was wrong with it?
april?
the 3d doesn't correspond to the 2d. when I click to color in next to the nerve, it pops up on a completely different area on the cube
ty and the cube was 43442 right?

@acida I'm not sure why, they don't handle transitional weather well
but not even put it down some degrees in summer?
here in austria a big part of the populations is pretty cheap so they try saving money where they can
are setting the thermostat to certain point and heat the oven when its really cold
our old place had central air and a heat pump, so it was nice and cheap...where we are now is all baseboards, so spendy to heat

yes, but I like my username... thats why i keep typing /nkem is shocked :D
How much time did you spend on it?
are points only based on time?
they're based on how you do against others who've done the same cube and volume, and a little bit on time
when half the cube is grey is that dead space?
I hate to go offline just when you all start...

How I met your mother...
i remember by knowing that the 'castor' part is why beavers were so important (the gland they were killed for) and that they were
so learning what the latin means helps too
@nkem yeah, knowing what it is at least the common name is a BIG start :P
Antilocapridae Americana (Sp?)
right, and seeing that you just 'know' what it is :P
@acida what's really important then is learning what some of the latin means, that was a HUGE help for me
'migrating turd' is how i remember it
latin is great because it usually tells you exactly what it is
yeah i learned latin but i'm wondering until today how i passed the class
Populus Tremuloides (Sp?)
yeah, I remember treumuloides because of how the leaves wiggle in the wind
what devil is that?
acidia - I would just try to learn what the latin root might stand for in the name
a frog with points?
frog, not toad, correct?
w/ spots?
butterfly?
Germans?
what? where?
Interesting, how the meaning changes from pronounciation
See?
overused and echo got mad?
no? wonder if I can
reb is not able to mute me?
dammit i don't know how to write ironic in english xD
it can not be reversed?
is that undoable or not undoable?
does that mean, it can be reversed?
is there a way to redo the tutorial? I keep getting really low points...
how do you do a private chat to someone on here?
Are all problems worth the same amount if you do them perfectly?
no, how much you fill in is part of it
and compared to what others do in the same cube
So does an expert review each problem?
Or does the AI just compare everyone's results?
But the computer would know the total of each one right?
not necessarily, b/c the computer doesn't know for certain what's actually there
I'm pretty sure there is an article or two on the blog that explains it, but I'm not sure how far back
ok play the tutorial and ask when you need something
is anyone here because of SourceFed?
what probelm?
are there any situations where the AI is completely correct?
is there a way to change the plane?
you mean change the AI colored parts?
sorry no idea what the pendant to "alt" is on mac
but you can look into the ? sign on the right down side
what are the points based on?
points are based on how you do compared to others who have done the same cube, volume, and a little bit on time
or did someone else do it? haven't looked at the forums today
isn't there a faq at ?-sign?
but that one's awesome, just a bit to dig through when you're new
yeah and provably boring when you just want to try (at least would be for me)
why is my submition taking so long?
how can i tell whether i'm correct or near correct with my blocks?
look carefully at the 3d and check for what doesn't belong
i meant when i am 'finished'
how does the scoring work then?
is more 'work' mean more blocks?
scoring is based on accuracy (being close to what everyone else said), and how much work you had to do, plus a tiny bit for time.
I see how it works now
Work is validated by people who know what is the "right" answer.
Lol that's why the quotes were there.
Part of me wonders why I keep getting cubes with not much to do... and then I think I'm missing something.
Oh? What am I missing?
So you know where you didn't get quite right
What is the coloring of our names based on? 
what was typing that supposed to do? 
I'm a software engineer. I don't know how to spell lol
didn't you say that the other night, and get told there was no custom colouring?
And how come my name isn't capitalized? I capitalized my username when I created an account.
royalrose which team are you on? 
what's pink?
ah, that's how this one is. 
awesome. I wonder what else the team thing does
at the moment? nothing
that awesome moment when you further complete a pathway
what other teams are there
That lame moment when you get one that the AI completely nailed. Also it was really small. 
x, reddit, facebook, twitter and?
That sad moment when you realize you forgot a huge area and added another area that wasn't suppose to be there
You try to think of some new memes? :)
lol what?

nkem weren't you going to bed?
Someone said five frames, did you also notice that it's easier if you slide up and down and watch the cells swim around? 
I like those numbers. I memorized them up to about 16 powers? I think.
not sure what is between 4096 and 65536 :D
but why 2^19?
Is that how high I went?
ok I'm going to see what 20 is.
did you add a lot of stuff?
what's that?
It stopped showing me what I was getting wrong.

I like it when it says this part is 'inforect' but it really is right. I don't get as many points, but I feel like I'm smarter than the guy
and how do you earn so many thousands of points?
can one repeat the tutorial?
?
I just found out how to redo tutorials by accident.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6ENAPXN9Lc&list=PL-IggV222ozT4CSVbb-bgJWfXPiO8FE_k&index=5
When it says what you did right and wrong, dismiss the score boards, but do NOT click move on. Instead, hit ESC, and then click the play but
Well it shows you what you did right and wrong first, so I call that redoing.
Didn't fold is cure some thing that had puzzled scientists?
if you change a cell does it change the chat room?
or macaque? can't remember
I really wish it told me how well I matched others in addtion to my score. 
when will they add a new neuron?
?
they are working on a new difficult SAC cell, right ketta? :D
/me knows how to use the /me command
whut?
?
<nkem>they are working on a new difficult SAC cell, right ketta? :D
so there are /me comands?
/queenlionhar meow?
or was it 104?

has anyone ever heard of Collin Raye?
/me says WHAT?!!!!?????
/me says has anyone heard of collin raye?
/me stole all po?nts from fudgecakesss
who has heard of mbti?
why does it keep on saying im a liar?
?
why can't i?
bleh. Who needs grammar anyways?
/me po?nts :-P
/me has more points?
so I guess I have more points?
/me knows where carmen sandiego is
YOUR neuron?
you own it?
how do you turn of chat again?
/me wonders how many secrets fudgecakesss is hiding from us 
is there any way to zoom in?
on 3d or 2d?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkE4aYclKEA
that's where the time based scoring comes in :)
who are you again?
I wonder how many points you would get if you colored everything? (not that I would do that)
so is a nubbin one where you don't need to make any changes?
@dax just very little. there are really very very few where you add absolutely nothing
come on, another nubbin?
do they give you easy ones if you suck?  because all om mine are easy and I suck off all day
any mods here?
what's the matter dax
Nothings wrong I am just curious how this is all organized
what do you mean? like who runs the project?
I am fascinated by the law of averages like if you get a bunch of people to guess how many jellybeans in a jar and take the average 
and get a close number.  I guess thats how this works
ah, that aspect? yes, that's how scoring is basically done
you know people don't really seem to understand how profound that is.  Like a standard curve in statistics
I certainly am...I love the citizen science-y part of it, I love the project, and how it's put together
that's kind of what amy does I think, or what she's working toward
they love suggestions btw, feel free to go through forums to see what others suggest, or make your own posts
?
who likes radiolab?
?
is anyone here not a scientist in any way besides me?
um how old are you guys ( not for personal info)
???
i still dont know what your talking about!
?
congratulations on being 14 when I was your age I was completely retarded 
What do you play ketta?
?!!!
Why is it that sometimes when I click an array, it won't accept it and fill the area in?
what he said
there are little areas like that sometimes, where clicks don't register
If it wasn't for you how would we get our coupons 
why do we talk about random stuff?
?
are you drinking happy?
you would be a lot cooler if you where
eliver?
jeez what'd you do lol
1000?
i seem to be getting a fair number of cubes already filled in, that's normal tho right?
hello?
i can talk on here?? wow. i'm new so yeah.
oh is that what this thing is for
how can i be better at the mapping? i suck at it!!
any idea how to get the 3d stuff outside of the box to show?
yea, thats why id like to see the rest around me
yeps. i wonder how they know if we're right or not on our mapping
so i can get an idea where stuff leads to
nobody knows where it leads to though, until we follow the path through each cube
that i don't know you. you don't know me. and yet what we do is all connected!
Anyone else keep losing connection to the chat server every few minutes?
what the hell kind of neuron is this
why
how come I can't see my name on the player scoreboard?
anybody here who could help me with this branch?
I would like to name the neuron I just mapped mustachio. All in favor despite not being able to see mustachio? 
hmmm I found this interesting "heat map"... but what does it mean? anybody?
Maybe it's where game activity is.
how do you see the heat map?
Any mods on?
what does the green bar at upper left mean?

is trailblazing when you get assigned a blank cube?
Trailblazing is when you are the first person to do a cube
it's when you're the first to work on a cube
hi amy - I have reached over 1 million overall points now - has anyone else reached 1 million?
can't remember who the other one is, reb or smalljude maybe?
and amy any ETA on new starburst?
Does it matter if I fix my mistakes after checking my work?
hehe :) I know what you mean :)
@jamie you have >1 million points??
hey btw jamie are you a he or a she? haha 
Maybe if there was a FPS version that would change?
how do you know when the tutorial is done and the game begins?
is it all a learning experience?
but the 'check my work' button remains?
at least, that's when you start getting scored on
when you're done w/ tutorial
so does it officially end once you've mastered finding the correct paths?
it ends when you've gone through all the tutorial cubes
by the end, you should have a fairly good idea of how to play
hows the start over buggy?
is there anyway to adjust the contrast on the 2d slice?
are we finding what already found???
doesn't tht defeat the purpose of the game???
you're basically correcting it and adding to what it knows
but it show u what u should've found and what u shouldnn't have filled -.-...
so im still doin tutorials???
it will tell you when you're on a 'real' cube
hey steve, so 4 people do the same cube to confirm its corect?
anyone know an estimate on how long they think it will take with all of us working to map the entire brain?
Yes. This is what I heard on the radio.
yeah...can you imagine how many cubes those will take? o.O
id like to know how many other people have looked worked on a cube
What do you mean?
that's what I've heard, I'm sure they're updating/improving all the time
the half blue one right?
is there a way to make this load faster?
get a laptop that has a good gaming processor?
did these things evolve?
How do i go back to the tutorials? I don't feel ready yet.
is it me or the game is laggy tonight?
how's the tracing going everyone?
why am I so addicted to this???
I'd like the 2 D cursor to be in another color. Any thoughts?
Try suggesting it in the forums?
is there a mod online.  Looks like I have maybe 2 neurons growing through each other?
What is the AI written in?
is echo the mod?
a few of us here have 'mod' powers (muting, banning)...but only echo and other yellow people can peek in on what you're working on
how are you involved on the project?
how long have you been playing?
so you're pretty good at this huh?
I think so, that's what they tell me :) Sometimes Any or echo will mention who is tops in accuracy
yeah..it's especially hard at first when you don't have anythign to compare to
but after a while you start to see what's right and wrong, and your score per cube helps you deduce that
I still get 20s and don't know why sometimes :-)
well, you can still move the 3D around once your score comes up, so when that happens w/ me I look more...
that's pretty much how you figure things out
that's what takes a while to figure out
I find myself amazed at how complicated this mouses eye is. There are so many other things in each of the cubes we are working on.
Does anyone know what all the other bits are?
So as a matter of intrest what is the big blob called, the one made up of manybe 12 cubes?
wtf is that yellow nerve thingy in teh background?
Hey, Cheet50, are you on???
Okay, neuroscientists, why do I tilt my head to the right when working out a challenging section of a neuron? 
can anyone tell me why i can't see myself on the scoreboard? anyone experiencing the same problem?
can you scroll down? and...are you in the tutorial?
I am past the tutorial... and I can scroll down and see all the scores, but I am not listed where my current score supposedly would be
let me see if I can find you when I finish this cube
and also when i click "this week" or "this month" nothing happens... can this be a browser problem? (i am using chrome)
ia that normal?
do any of you play foldit?
what ?
how can i change my nacionality?
how's everyone doin today
Great.  How are you?
I'm pretty excited to see how everyone's contributions help the science of exploring these neurons
This pulls at my gamer heartstrings.  Heard about it on npr and had to come see what it was about
NPR was what turned me on to it this past week
you never go to bed or on a walk?
It is hard to get high scores unless you get certain blocks.  Is there a trick to getting the big ones?  
Is it slow today?
the game?
Or is it just my computer?
I read about the game in an European newspaper - that is why I started
so where are you all from then?
the game jaimie? yeah... I noticed
isn't it kind of crazy how people from all over the globe are working on this
I'm a little worried that I"m going to get a message pretty soon that says, "You know what, you suck at this. We're going to cut you off now
what happens when you blunder?
@grizle: what age where you when you first had access to a computer?
First access as in hands on? 16
How do they know if you are right or wrong?  I thought the point of this was that they don't know what it looks like.
I'm not 100That was what I had surmized
How long has this game been going?
How did you first hear about it?
Has there been a huge increase of players in the past week or so?
So, the NPR guy said he was 'novice' level.  How can you tell what level you are?
Is the lag usually this heavy?  I was thinking maybe the influx of people has bogged the servers
there might be a lot on right now, and it looks that way when you do a /who
not sure how many are actually playing
from what amy says, there will continue to be promotions and 'bumps' on shows/sites, so this will keep happening
but they definitely don't recommend filling it all in...while some get you lots of points they take forever and aren't what they care much
when I get those, I wish I had a 'click and drag' option to color large areas
what do the points actually mean? Sometimes I get a cube that has very few modifications required, and some are really hard
do points reflect that?
I think it's supposed to be mostly accuracy.  The closer you are to what others have done in that square the more points you get.
I saw someone refer to a cube with a number the other day.  Is there a way I can see that number?
2 points short of what?
Can't see the 3D image at all?
and are you using chrome or something else?
which one does it work  best with?
okay thanks lets see what happens
nkem...ever hear of a band called einsturzende neubauten over there in Deutchland?
me too, love it when he does stuff w/ Nick Cave and PJ Harvey
I agree :) Ever get to see him live?
depressing? nah...I love their work :) but that's just me
how much points do you guys have
'Your' actual vision or the slides?  I get that way when I've had too many beers =p
I'm a little fussy with how many times I have to refresh to get things going
What's that got to do with anything?
Speaking words of wisdom?
did everyone in the US remember to set their clocks an hour ahead?
grr.  I get so fussy when I've been working on a cube for a fair bit and it stops responding after awhile. 
Word made it look like poo, but I'd liek some input on the content. corrections, additions, etc?
only one question - you mention an area at the bottom of the screen where you can click to change some game settings like trace color
is that a new feature that's still being rolled out or am i missing it?
is there any plans for more of those? I would imagine so but I don't know anyone on the dev team
Is it possible for a cube to be completed by the AI already? Like one where there is nothing to fix..?
when you get a cube that looks like nothing branches off at all should i skip it or say im finished?
You mean, you got a dead end?
how can you tell if youre done?
typically when you're pretty sure there isn't anything else to add...no empty spaces from the starting piece, etc.
does anyone else just end up getting like 30 points a couple times in a row even though you think you're doing well?
how do i zoom in and out on the 3d cube image?
how does everyone get so many points,i get like 5 in a row for like 20 points and everyone else is like getting hundreds of points
I SUCK TOO, HOW IS EVERYONE SO GOOD AT THIS?!
how do i get it to go to fullscreen? :(
so all the available cell types have all been mapped already right?
I started from, but just touches it in an intersecty-looking way, is it better to leave it there just in case, or delete it?
Is there a holiday today in USA?
btw, ketta... maybe it is possible to include some more links in the FAQ? :) Like to the official FAQ and the youtube tutorial videos? :)
noted :) I'm going to clean it up when I get home from classes today (fix the bad formatting from Word) and I'll do that
hello?
how are things
yeah, really boring, isn't it? :D
you guys ever get the feeling that youre doing it wrong?
how old are you guys?
does' it work on safari now?
what version of safari?
will figure out why, one sec
you know why, echo? :)
why does this game keep calling my name 
Um... are those whispering voices? During you're asleep?
nope even when I'm awake 
on a philosophical note, has anyone started wondering if anyone in the 4th dimension is mapping our 3D cross-sections to map causal chains?
Well, 4D beings can move freely through time, so... The Doctor?
I'm not sure what a 4D being would look like. if there is a 2D being, we'd just show up as "slices" to them, so not sure about an equivalent
another species?
ah, where did I put my tin-foil hat...
I don't remember Cubeland in the book. @gooda778, I liked it a lot when I read it 10 years ago
have you read any kurt vonnegut before?
/me earned 1001 po?nts
how'd you get 1001 nkem?
hmm, can you get negative points?
/me earned -10 po?nts
can you dot the i ?
Does the colour of the neuron in the overview have a meaning, keep wondering that. Like green near completion or something ?
i know how except for the code for the short bar :)
/me earned 9001 po?nts
yeah, I think the turkish ? is more subtle
how does the point system work on this?
/msg nkem po?nts po?nts po�nts
Uh-oh... echo updating the chat server? :D
hm... po*nt(s) ?
echo, will we get a new cell to work on soon?
/me earned 1234 p?oints
that was a "p?oints" :D
see what happens when you mess with the man?
/me e?a?r?n?e?d 1?0?0?0 p?o?i?n?t?s
/msg nkem T e?st
what is going on
/me earned ? and has taken the lead permanently
/msg nkem 0?
Hey echo, is the transparency already remembered? *evil grin*
how on earth did you get that many points
it's what admins do when they get bored
you were watching me coloring my cube? :D
is that even possible?
comprendo un poco la din�mica, sin embargo aun despu�s de terminar no hago �puntos, qu� debo hacer?
 ????? dont speak espenol
but.. when i finish i dont do points, why?
same with my friend i dont really know why
have u did points?
Did you get past the tutorial level?
cuantos cubos son del tutorial?
what does it mean that you "trailblazed" a cube?
do you guys know how the point system works?
is it like the more similar your cube is to the others means more point?
Also how long you spend on the cube
on how much of the strand is in the cube
i keep getting ones that are basically done. Am I doing something wrong?
but heck what do i know, i like physics not biology :P
Isn't the AI supposed to get betteras well ? 
Hey what is the easiest cell?
why i can't submit my cube ?
twice?!!
How did you get 1000 points?
????????
how do I repeat the tutorial?
so any one have steam?
no...why?
you mean comercials?
use i?
?????
that's great! How old is he?
how old?
Does he play also?
how are you today ketta? Congrats on top score
yourself?
how do you spank someone
?
and now we know why emoting was put in the game :)
used to say you were a liar when you did that :)
what did he do?
talking to me?
how's it going everyone?
@kingandrew what's up?
stuck how?
and how's reb today?
Question.... how do you earn points
really?
i don't like to write new code when i'm this tired ;)
what is team x?
/msg nivchek arrrgghhh?
huh?
I don't like to concentrate on anything when I'm tired. Except a book. In bed. Or just bed.
what computer are you using?
u runnin lion?
/msg nivchek an admin? no...I just have some moderator powers. I can mute and ban people, but that's it
i know right?
nivchek?
on the tutorial/new cell? 
i practice what my professor calls "gut-feeling microbiology" when we're calling how an experiment will turn out
May I ask what the bar on the upper left corner in the overview screen is?
doesn't fly when you're writing up your research though :P Usually I can verbalize by then
@architect, love it!  what do you do when you're not playing eyewire?
But since nobody knows how large the neuron is going to be, it is not *that* reliable
architect I think I know what he means...it's all there but the rest of him can't get it out
haha how about you?
what about 4mo ago?
huh?
what's up nkem?
Is it possible to get a cube where there's nothing to find?
How do I know when I'm done?
when you hit a rounded end
how important is it that we get every little teeny bit, if it's the centre?
Are you doing part of what I call the big blob?
what system  
does anyone know if any browser in particular is superior for eyewire?
oh cool. it went away when I clicked. that was creepy, looked like something out of dexter
there's a few where the 3d doesn't load - just skip the cube
when you say the left screen isn't working, is there nothing showing up?  is it an empty cube?  checkerboard?
What does it mean to trailblaze a cube?
how's it going everyone! 
Well, and yourself?
Did you all see that there's a new J Cell up?  
All good - although I was thinking being able to change your paintbrush size to XL when you're doing the middle would be nice!
That's great news - is this the pace you guys were expecting?
why it keeps saying on J Cell 5 that i have finished all the cubes
In the usa now day or night ?
11:57pm where I am (central time)
who has time for sleep these days, anyway?
Anyone else here from Canada get an american flag by their name? I've been wondering for a while if it's just me.
I don't mind what country it says I'm from as long as I'm helping.
@jasonrose71, how close are you to the border?
How old are you guys/gals ? i was just wondering 
geez, wheres all the kids?
Most of the kids are in bed, where they should be!
when dose it start
what time do you finish school?
I actually meant what time this afternoon :-)
why
its longer in canada ? 
especally where albanians learn ( my self)
What town in Macedonia?
Oh, right near the border, right?
what do you want to do?
So you like untangling problems?
christie, you sound like a really nice person. How did you start doing this?
Apparently so many came here when they posted about it, it crashed the servers.
They should devote more servers to this one, the lag when all the Americans are awake is insane.
hey sorry was out for a bit. @jason really? about what time does that happen?
wow, crazy! does echo know about this?
I thought you could only change the opacity? 
that's what I get for behaving! :)
how's it going
how is it going for you?
that's what I like to hear
echo, how does it work to leave my cube unfinished let let my computer sleep until I come back?
but did you try "/me learned 1000 pointless things today"? ;)
 @echo how do you like this color?
bright pink ! ? :p
i dont know what im doing
hehe can you really do that??
looks like g+, or not?
TeamX?
or is it permanent?
at what?
chatting?
gold?
what can brown do for you
bronze?
platinum?
copper?
too close to admin?
how about this
hm, echo - why not WebGL-Chat :D
when you graduate from top player of the day it changes to...
white?
what do you want?
maybe a glow effect? :)
/msg amyleerobinson is there a special command? :D
i'm losing my purple? darn
hah that didn't work, I forgot how to send messages...
/msg amyleerobinson maybe we pick a color for moderators?
mod color? 
what are we testing?
any way i can help?
team reaper?
And now I am admin?
/msg echo did you change the command?
/msg nkem which command?
/msg nkem same command -- wait did that work for mods? :D
/msg echo /color rgba(255,0,255,1)?
hm?
why are colors an issue, things changing soon?
how do you tell what cube you're in?
trailblazer? I don't think so...
WAS IT THE 1k CUBE?
how do you know which cube is which?
skip it?
I only get this if I click "return to overview" when I see my score
quite the opposite of Vegas?
what? nkem is a liar? :P
how did I get in here?
should i do it again or not?
how many people are on here?
/me wonders why nkem is still trying?
@nkem, not going for points?
/me got it wrong?
im confused. whats happening? :P
didn't you already say this one hour ago?
normal? lol
Loss of colors?
can i mute you? :D
how, can i undo this?
/msg echo maybe those with special chat powers  should be a different color? Tho green is nice
how can i unmute?
please people, how can I put my coutry flag in my name?
/msg echo I am really sorry, you know that? :(
what are they supposed to be=
me green?
no reb?
what'd you doooooo
how old are you guys?
echo, I believe, yellow is not the right thing?
hm?
how goes the eyewiring today?
glitchy how?
Oh, /me deactivated?
when science gets interesting ^^
what about /team default
and /team moderator?
what?
I've never gotten more than 60-ish, and mostly 30-40 ... does that mean I'm just getting them wrong? 
what's new echo?
so no more fun name colors?
Also: is it possible to get ones where there's nothing to do? Has happened to me a couple times, the dark blue looks complete.
Is the team thing only colors?
Or also moderator rights?
is there a mod color now?
green?? ew!
hm?
so why aren't you yellow?
huh? I am not?
Maybe... you need a refresh? :D
pulling legs?  you're both yellow to me
soooo... i feel like i'm just guessing with this game?
refreshed, ketta? :D
poke echo when he's done making food
you're supposed to be red rerentki?
how are you today ketta?
what class?
less busy today architect?
What do colors mean?
Is there a way to make the computer load the quadrant of the cell that the nuron is in first so that we can work while it loads?  *incredibl
to what? :D
what what?
What is an oldtop?
how are you?
do i need to refresh or...?
but why is nkem now turquoise
see?
or echo?
so, all colors are working, now?
what color am I supposed to be?
do i need to join a team?
So what just happened with the update?
what is team x?
@ketta you see green?
/msg echo Oh no, I was admin? :D And didn't make any use of it?
?
what is that bar in the top left corner when you change cells?
If I reload the browser will I lose my cube?
When will there be a downloadable client?
so is that line what we are aiming for?
we're trying to stay in blue/green spectrum. @nkem, @ketta, @reb, thoughts on mod color?
@troyboy when computers can download over a terabyre of data :)
@amy, are you doing colors for new leaders or past leaders?
oh well, I'll try for that when thesis is done :)
:) how's that going btw?
8 weeks left. can only eyewire when big analyses are running
ok so you all are okay with that purple? lighter, darker? 
So being online automatically gives a vote?
amy how many mods are there?
about?
3?
what?
How many different people see each cube?
see? you mean like color it?
Yes, how many work on each cube?
depends on how accurate people worked on the cube
@auraseer, depends on how accurate the people mapping were, if very accurate, only 3 I think
So how can we see how accurate we've been?
ditto, I care more about how many cubes I "join" and accuracy than points
hate it when i screw up
There was a top 10 list?
sorry for that stupid question... Starbust = Starbust Amacrine Cells = SAC?
is that what the new tutorial is for?
@masterweaver yea the problem is that accuracy is built on what other people map so it could show you an inaccurate accuract score..so..yea
So, I should train a bit more on SAC #1, hm? hm....
I would at least like to know the breakdown of my points. If I get 280 from some cube, how many are from accuracy and how many are 
because I was slow?
sorry if you said earlier...what's the status on the starburst test thingy?
don't specify what auraseer?
you did?  where is that @ketta?
wa, why am I purple?
which other ones do you want us sticky?
what's awesome @ketta, thanks!
@rprentki you're player #23? Awesome!
are admins still going to be red?
that's what I said :P
what
what
@nkem I'm just glad to be able find it when I want to link it
everyone is purple? crap!
how did I do that haha
hey guys :) how's it going? 
do you have a personal favorite? 
Isn't springbreak a great student festival? (source: The Simpsons)
can you do blue to yellow?
or blue to light purple?
what color is my name for you eas6a1
so yellow stays for mods and admins them? I'm putting this in a blog post
are those css-styles?
why are mods and admins the same color? :(
I mean, something like? -webkit-linear-gradient(
thoughts?
like best of the day and so?
when's your birthday?
If I'm earning points does that mean I'm doing the real stuff or could I still be on tutorial?
What would that change? :D
it used to show how many you still had to go
Should we downvote the others? *evil grin*
on j5 alrady?
what did you mean with "after that 2 more"
Are those J-Cells special?
Thats what I meant
total of 7 j-cells?
Yeah, but... from what?
Are those connected to a special cell we already did?
if they're looking for connections, likely 7 cells from same retina? I could be full of it though
therefore, must all be from same retina?
you have those EM-Images of the whole retina? Or just a small area?
are those the ones with 'spines' you were talking about a few weeks ago?
also doing some pyrimidal cells?
any update on the starburst cell test that sebastian was talking about?
and those are new tutorials?
no...it's a test to see how good you are w/ starburst neuron cubes
so, SAC#1 didn't go well? :D
when you select to map for  astarburst cell (in the future) you'll be prompted through a series of challenge cubes
ok, just wanted to know how concentrated i hav to be^^
LOVE it when that happens
is there an admin around? I just would like to know, if there is a 3d piece missing or if it is really slow again
which cube?
been slow for you all day nkem?
Clicking on the 2D view should be disabled when the confirmation box for submitting cube is open
just now?
hey, I'm making sure my chat is working, is anyone there?
what?
how's your eve going jamie?
that was a long time ago...can you mute people?
good - don't know how much I can play - I am moving in a few weeks and have chores
are you almost done?
that's tough, happy with where you're going? I'm not almost done, but will make it I think :)
what is your thesis on?
don't like callifornia?
where in CA?
wow?
exactly why I'm getting into zoology
Is this new cell a starburst?
from what amy was saying, the starburst is coming soon
now microbes can really smell bad, except pseudomonas aeroginosa (sp) which smells pleasantly like grapes when grown on blood agar I think
guess you never know what conversation you'll happen upon in eyewire
dont' know how I got green
why am I green?
forever?
so... what's the story about that wishbone :)
ahh... you see I was kinda making a play on words here. "what's the story wishbone" old lymeric to a pbs show
that's where I have to say that I'm french speaking, hence not have that cultural background? :s
I know, I can, as long as first and last letter are in place. but it's still a mistake if it wasn't intended, right?
or am I mistaken about that?
why do I only get cube with tiny specs and no job to be done???
go rad somthing on the net in between?
where would i ask?
the contact us on the ? sign on the right bottom of your screen
maybe a dumb question, but how does one trailblaze?
btw...what is your cat's name? he/she is so flippin' CUTE
LOL I love names like that what's the 137 stand for?
is this chatroulette ?
Does the game randomly choose who trailblazes?
so, ketta, do you work at MIT?
I tend to be around when things get discussed (among some other people), and we're able to ask questions and get answers
Do you know how many cells they plan to map with this?
each cube is just a tiny part of the cell, right?
Are these electron microscopy images we are looking at?
no..I can't remember what the process is called right now
So what do you think they are? All computer generated?  
what do the cubes measure on a side?
i don't know if you can do TEM with SBF...anyone?
HUH?
It's probably where these images came from.
how do the determine the progress toward complete mapping of a cell?
they have a lot of equipment they don't use or know how to use
what kind of lab?
I start in a couple weeks and I'm one of those people who wants to learn how to do *everything* so I'm useful
anyone?
that's why they make you go through a long tutorial...you learn as you go along
@crazyman, the extra section on cell body of J cell #5?
echo, rprentki, anyone around to answer a question?
we're wondering why there are two cells on J cell #5...did we mess up and grim hasn't reaped yet?
Yeah, I wondered why it was giving me cubes completely off from the cell
Maybe it really is just a different cell and should be considered as such?
echo, not to bug you too much, but does eyewire know what kind of cell this is?
One question, are cell bodies of different cells usually close together?
So who was the top user yesterday?
what is a blue player?
twitteR?
Will there be a color for weekly and monthly top scorers too?
did I find a cell body by accident or what
I wonder how the 3D view would look like if we colored every neuron in the cube
or what
what was the code?
empty like nothing selected at all?
what cube reb?
46313?
? How do you see the code?
are you still on it?
are you on it now?
do they work?
When I get a cube that doesn't look like it is attached to the rest of the cell, should I skip it?  Can I assume that it might be part of
another cell?
Ya think? ;)
@couc, when it doesn't show connections when cube appears?
I'm not sure what you mean.  I'm assigned a new cube "out in space" far from the other lines 
@couc, that's fine. Just means they're not sure where it fits yet -- that's our job :)
That's why I wasn't sure anymore
when a lot have been generated, they don't fit anywhere yet
Do you earn points for trailblazing as soon as someone else submits the cube?
I think seeing what you've got wrong on cubes that are completed would be a very useful feature
That's what I meant
no yelling please, what do you need help with?
I'M A SIMPLE TUMBLR CHILD, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS
are you doing the tutorial?
Yes? Maybe? I dunno!!!!
woah :D echo is actually listening to me? :)
and rainbow color?
oh it's not working reb?  alas so far it only works if you're set up as a mod
How come I never saw lyndsey here before? :D
/msg echo to return to purple, type /team mod ?
now?
Is the client downloading all the cube data at once?
echo are you not on your own team?
nkem, how many points are you at?
What am I supposed to do with a corner?!
@crazyman could you type something in chat if you're online?
Yah, when do I get paid?
is @echo here?
I found out how to access the heat map controls
does anyone know how i can put my country flag before my name in rank? i tried settings but didnt work
is one one there?
with some anrwers?
so is there anyone with an idea?
How do you know if you're really done? And if it's correct?
Are you out of the tutorial?
That's where we come in to play
Got it. Is it more right the more points you get? sometimes I get 150 points, anmd sometimes I get 20...
that must take a lot of practice...every once in a while the 3D decides not to show up when I'm tracing
Who needs to do anything else when you're doing something this important!
Oh, does the 2D slices glitch out sometimes? And only show up as a checker pattern? That makes things difficult.
@abyssia when the site is slow, that happens sometimes yes
yeah...I don't think telling professors 'FOR SCIENCE!' will work when I'm pursuing a zoology degree! Unless I get THEM hooked on it..
You've just found out how to gain a 1st (or whatever the equivalent is in your country)
It's always the moment of truth, because i don't know if i even know what I'm doing...
This is a stupid question, but what actually are these? CT scans of random nerves?
That's what it looks like to me. What I don't really understand is why it all looks bunched up like brain folds, and we're just matching the
That's how it was explained to me.
Is it wrong that i find it pleasing to just flick through the slices and watch the little blue blob slide about?
starburst neurons?
It's what it called it
how do you change what you do
anyone else play that?
Fricken AI. This is why we can't have nice things.
gg?
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO CATCH THAT?
how long have you been doing this?
me? Just started yesterday
I want to know how much has been mapped by players. anyone know
I really just want to see how my cube matches up with the rest
Oh, what? I guess I am too. basically. The second starburst. Oh god, this dosn't look fun
Are you medicine students ?
What's awesome about it?:P
that moment when you click on a seemingly small bit and it turns into this huge freaking thing...
anyone else caught by surprise by ggogle reader's shotdown? any replacement suggestion?
81 percent, not bad, with how freaking impossible this cube was
which one?
mostafa, answering to who?
While you focus on going vertically, make sure you check the bottom too. That's what i missed.
So THAT'S what my husband was yelling abut
do you use somthing ese?
@sara   Did you blog about Eyewire a few weeks ago?  That's how I got here. do you have 2 daughters ;-)
where are you from?
@couc, do I know you? or you just stumbled on my blog?
how do you retry a level?
how do they check work if they dont have the answer?
ketta is your name purple because you are a science man and or woman?
dunno why i said and..
what does trailblazed a cube mean?
I went waaaaaaay off where the cube was telling me so i did 'Move on" to see how bad I did and I was doing it right... o.O
game of the year?
in 2d and 3d what does center 3d on point mean?  I see something happening, but am not sure what exactly
so them it rotates around that?
Why test the chat...
did you break something? :D
why just in english?
wait..there's a test server? o.O
do you make backups first, or are you like most devs? :)
speaking of excitement (sorta), did you get any pics of that baby panda you saw in SD?
it wasnt sure how to get in the faux-pond they had
it was with mom? that's cool!
can you describe the sound a panda makes?
do you remember when zoos had so much trouble getting and keeping babies alive?
they were pretty quiet when I was there :)
what's up mauri?
what i have to do?
yes?
just read what you said..looking forward to a challenge!
grr...my cat kicked my mouse...missed what you just said amy
so amy...did you get through the test?
why isn't my 3d working?
might be a little slow to load...which cell are you in?
J-cell ?
end?
ren53..do you know which cell you're in?
how can you tell which cube you are working on?
why khetta rainow clors
did you get through the test?
Hey Ketta, How did you get a rainbow chat name?
night ketta if you're still here. oo I wasn't online -- who was top at midnight? 
how can one be a mod ?
that's why I share my magic tricks with the world :D
/msg rprentki Good morning, are you there? :)
gisela, you are one of the more experienced users. Do you know of branches that go completely thru darker cell parts?
how can I see it?
when I was not sure in the beginning, I just finished and looked at the resulting points: 1 to 19 meens you didn't not put enough effort in,
but I want to know, what this dark area is :D
and when around 10like you just couldn't paint?
could you erase?
or do anything else like submit?
what happens is, each piece you add has a corresponding "mesh" that gets rendered in 3d
when you select tons of them, your browser has trouble rendering all of them
that is what I told a new college some hours ago - but I am just lazy
yeah that's why I usualy work the edges of the main cell bodies
just the edges then?
/msg echo Hi echo, is there a GrimReaper with available time somewhere near you? :)
hm?
HI, guys, i'm new, any advice?
does this mean that i'm doing non-tutorial cubes now?
The amount of crazy men is increasing, hm?...
whoops weren't you purple before the reboot?
You put me to team echo, again?
just click the "?"
yay! happy pi day.. when is mole day?
Is this a tumor?
huh?
hmmm?
that's what i meant
ok what am i missing? about the pi thing thought pi was constant thought the universe
? 
I'm in Canada but have an american flag, what team am I on?
depends on how you tell time
the lines i thought you color in one section, but when i remove the lines it looks like part of my neuron is separate 
is there a label for the cubes?  wondering to see if you could work with someone on them.
oh crazy are you still here?
/msg crazyman4865 you said you found a way to get the heat map to show up?
my question about this whole process: do neurons develop the same in every person?
You have a 3d view, holly?
if we solve this sample (whatever creature it is from) will it map to others/humans/etc?
/msg crazyman4865 this is on windows?
/msg crazyman4865 okay cool, I'll check it out when I get home. (no windows comps at work)
as you add to the neuron's path, does the 3d view update?  mine doesn't
so, does the work we do on this apply to all mice, or just this (dead) mouse for whom crossections were generated?
how about spelling it 'genes' so people don't get confused?
So I guess I'm the only one doing this naked? lol
so what's up with this short fetish that everyone has now I don't get it
lol echo..do you have a little fort built around them?
@blackblues where are you?
carzy where are you?
why sorry? :D
yeah I'll only ride during rush hour -- it's the only time when boston traffic moves at a pace I can predict
bicycle capital? Amsterdam? Brussels?
Did you see "Die hard 4"?
where are you troy?
I love when you honk at someone here and they give a retaliatory honk back
that's why you can't belive every thing you see in hollywood
any tips to smoothly change the orientation in 2d?  
@echo that happens here a lot too...doesn't matter how close they came to creaming me
so you can zoom in on the 2d section but can you scroll around it?
but in the future?
btw, are you using fullscreen mode? (F11 on windows)?
what would pan in 2d be
can't we just alt right click in 2d?
pressed middle mouse button? :D
So when do we get a downloadable client?
What advantages you see from a downloadable client, troy?
that's what I said vilo
ahh that's what I meant srry
yeah, that's what i meant
really?  where can I get it?
o.0 i did what? havnt hit submit in like 15 min
Yeah, you don't have some source code for me, echo? MIT licence? *chrm*
how fast is your net?
I don't know... it's slow?
btw, echo - did you change the links in the header? (Play, Wiki, Forum, About)
How about making eyewire a bit slower?
you know what's coming?
any suggestions?
You mean, something like: "Thats the annoying tab, where the music comes from"?
mapyanjing, try selecting something?
Is J cell #4 close to completion ?
  my nerve is loading slowly any others with that problem?
for this cube, I mean. I won't continue, until I know, what I colored here
ahhh colabrative effort.  how things actually get done
mm?
Would it be possible to include the maximum possible amount of points you can get for a cube?
whatcha mean?
oh, how that?
I thought my results are compared to the majority?
hm?
oh wait, it doesn't make sound when I have chat open! It's good to know how your own code works...
oh, so you need a sound?
Ok, someone clue me in. Am I blindly clicking until I find a good patch?
Because I don't see how what's already revealed helps me get to other areas.
see something like that? :D
Hobby neuroscientists: What is that:
@nkem, the black splotch?
that's why I don't want to hit submit before I know, what it is
black splotch eh? let me take a look
can you see all the craziness I'm adding?
oh did you?  It only showed me the seed piece when i looked
oh?
so, dark is nothing special?
just "dye"?
(that's what i was told)
Umm... does that mean, we miss the branch?
What is this bit of cell that is yellow in my cube?
so, is it possible to "adjust" that cube in the overall view?
@rprentki, is there a merger on J-Cell #4? Big straight piece?
Difficult SAC test? HA, bring it on :D
holy crap why is it so slowwww
How many GB / TB of data does one cell need? Approximately? :D
can you pick a cube?
?
/msg nkem still as laggy?
and now we have 20? :D
are there any eyewire developers on here?
hey echo? are you there?
for those cubes where I'm in the middle of the body of the neuron I'd really like a bigger coloring brush!
ah wait maybe I know what's happening
really?
okay now I see what you mean, sorry..
I guess I understood what you mean :) 
how do you trailblaze a cube?
"Trailblazing What the heck is that?" :D
so have I just never been the first to work on a cube?
Any scientists on?
when did you join gusgraham?
what?
Hey echo could you add a symbol to the bookmark icon thing?
wonder where our old one went
whats with the big fat picture from the blog?
oh, did i got the same cube again?
ok, I think, te problem is on my side... anyone else have no 3d view?
allllmost ready? :D
is that something like minutes or days?
that was my next question: "less than 1440 minutes"? :D
it won't let you select it?
oops I refreshed in stead of coing back to the page -- did I msis anythinh?
How often can we redo the test? Exam anxiety, you know...
?
You have to reach an accuracy threshold to be "in"?
/msg amyleerobinson doesn't that encourage cheating?
/msg echo how could they cheat though? 
so, 12 cubes in 20 minutes is better than 15 cubes in 20 minutes?
because I reached the necessary accuracy within 12 cubes?
Hah!  is that why I'm so slow at this game?  I can do like 3-4 cubes in 20 minutes.
/msg echo well crap hmm..do you think most people will do that? I'll take it out of the blog post
still?
even with the extended cache?
Doesn't leaving the window open all night just slow down the servers?
we don't send a whole lot of data when you're not actively playing
is the tutorial live now?
@echo is the game client removing cube data when you complete it
from the browser you mean?
yeah, it is freeing it for garbage collection, but it's up to your browser how it decides to clean up
Then I can blame it on chrome that I have to refresh every now and then?
When RAM usage crosses 1,5GB? :D
how do you close the chat? is there a setting for it? i'm goin gto be doing a demonstration for students soon
are they all logged in as you?
yeeeah if you sign in two places at once, it selects what you select on all of the computers
Is there a way to select the region you want to do?
What about scrolling zoomed in 2d?
is anyone trying the starburst level?
already online?
what is that level?
maybe hard refresh if you've been on a while?
nkem, maybe echo banned you ? better be nice to him...
only to make you try even harder, he knows how you like a challenge
nkem, are you signed up for blog updates? 
am I supposed to have a progress bar in the SAC#1?
ahh.. when?
nkem, did you see the post? Didn't it make it sound like it was live?
is it that time again?
Who's not done yet? :D
tell us when
you just noticed the blue?
echo, are you asking us to submit?
how do I get on?
did you read the blog post?
Do I go somewhere else to return later on?
SO, all of the cells say that I have finished all available cubes....any thoughts?
all of the cells rjz?
how do you re do the tutorial?
What do i do
how do I reproduce this
can no one get a cube?
why are you interested in this challenge?
who?
The score table?
Is the Starbust Challenge working yet?
what is "mapping the brain" anyway?
have you done the tutorial?
but what is "mapping the brain"
what's the purpose of this
Is anyone else not getting the proceed box to go to the next cube?
What fixed it?
what
is chat upside down and backwards for anyone else?
using chrome?
How do you stop messages from popping up
�o??? `?????q s??? s?
So no one else is getting the no=proceed-box issue anymore?
still not working echo?
p: o??? ?ood
/msg nkem p: o??? ?ood
/msg echo o??? `?ou ??o? ?? s?op
o??? `?ou ??o? ?? s?op
So, it was Chrome beta?
no proceed option?
When I submit the cube, nothing happens after
I don't think I left it open at work?
you can't click?
can you check the js console for errors?
but you know how that goes
Why does it keep saying practice 1 of 6 ? 
noone else ran into this problem?
which one ?
But you also got the green/red feedback?
that's what happens
why is my 3D cube blank? 
anyone? 
any ideas? 
about what?
why my left side cube, the 3d one is blank? 
Is it still blank if you skip to the next one?
was there ever a 3d view?
Have you signed out and then back in?
tried a different browser?
hey a5hmor, still doing the SAC?
"Haha, did you see that wrong piece, he just added?! Stupid nkem!" :D
anyone else experiencing a bug where you don't see all the neural pathway in 3D, and as you color in, it doesn't show in 3D?
should I keep drawing neruons or go watch online models?
dunno why
whats that?
whats the website?
cool!!!?
some people say first person shooters make people go on killing sprees but who's to say this game doesn't?
i imagine a future where the maps to the FPS are based on scientific research, so we can get all those people to help, too
thats what i'm taling about
cubes won't submit - have refreshed many times - anyone else having this problem?
its acting up,  i wait for it to say my point in chat log down here then skip cube when it does it <shrug>
Yeah, but thats where the new SAC challenge happens :D
how many are there?
does anyone know how to predict the lottery? like the powerball?
Thats why I do this. Their bad conscience will force them to spend some of the lottery win to me :D
what does it mean when  I submit and nothimg happens?
And the fix isss?
So,, restart?
?
Isn't that the one, where a popup tells you: "There is a merger!"
?
:) what's happening?
@ketta are you making it through though?
I really would like to know what my final score was :D
Noobie here. The program won"t give me a new cube after I've submitted my finished cube. Suggestions?
@ketta I think cube 2 is meant to show people what a merger looks like and how to trace around it. Trick cube!
but skip doesn't give you your points does it?
because part of the wrong part is goodno?
what's going on?
hmm @jamie I thought I made you a mod -- do you want to be one?
amy, do you know what your count should be at?
@rachel I'm not sure what it started on but by cube 2 it said i was on cube 5 of 6, now it's said 6 of 6 for a while
are you guys in the tutorial when you're having trouble?
cool, how far through it are you guys?
but which level?
and nice nkem, how many cubes did you go through?
Huh? 12
Is there a score? Something to brag with? :D
sounds like you were the first?  once we confirm that's got to be worth some serious braging rights
@nkem you get double points. Do you guys want t special color in chat? That's about all we can do right now... :)
I have done many cubes in SAC, but it always says practice 1 of 6.  I didn't get a progress bar either.  Is it normal?
trace around the merger? see...I'd skip this
Never, couc?
Never a progress bar.  Is it what you mean?
ok, so it WANTS me to trace that nasty part?
I'm a little unsure about what's expected here
couc, I assume you did refresh? :D
if you skip a cube then do you have to start your count over again from cube 1?
I want you to find where it continues through the merger, and then deselec the ufly merger
of stage 1 or 2?
man the one I'm on right now, is beyond my brain power for tonight. If I come back tomorrow, will it still be at 3 of 6?
but this worked on the test server?
@amy are you learning from the tutorial at least?
you disagree nkem?
I was stuck on the 6th cube, I logged off and on, does anyone know if it affected my score?
Did you seriously do it in 12 cubes?? 
@nkem, you too?
?
any possible way to do those core cubes quicker?  I end up giving up becuase my browser becomes so slow
i always wonder how the AI missed them
how's you do on that nasty merger one?
which one?
the one where you have to work around it
time bonus?
Did I mention, that it is not just accuracy, but also time that counts?
serious?
more/less?
is better?
oh I'm done already? that wasn't 12 cubes...
OK, now, I wee if what is correct, incorect, missing, but no score... What do I do?
you finished tutorial?
are you on the 7th cube?
yeah..that wasn't 12 cubes. Was it supposed to be?
how can you tell what status you are?
@amy not sure what you mean, what does it take to go through the starburst challenge?
you need 6 in a row above 90so that's why I didn't have 12 cubes
well ketta, you should have had 12, no idea why you didn't
@admins, did you see my problem?  In SAC
but that doesn't answer my question, how do you know what status you are?  for example, @amy or @rprentki your names are in yellow
/msg ketta Had your last cube three boutons?
information about how I did.
Just a quick question: how do I turn you 'dinging' people off? :)
@ketta, not interested in double starburst points?
what's the grey section of the core in J5?
double points??
what is SAC? (sorry for newbness)
it's just those are 2x what they would have been
cube 4 or 4 cubes?
Were the JS-errors helpful, echo?
Why doesn't anything happen when I click "I'm finished"?
echo?
is SAC always double points or just for now?
@echo, I'm in SAC, when I click Check my work, I see what is correct, incorect or missing, but don't see any points or progress.  
Am I still progressing?
@couc that was during the 2nd section yea? same here
It's the third one where I don't have a score
This error came when pressing "Check my work"
@nkem and @ketta, curious to hear your ideas as to how we could reward players who pass the star challenge
when was this nkem
oh, darn... can you check, when I did the Challenge?
@echo errors I posted first happend when I clicked "I'm finished" the first time
You mean "Check my work"?
back...and amy, instead of name colors, are you able to do badges of some sort?
amy can you help me out with debugging?
how can I help
tell me what goes wrong
email it to you?
yikes, what's going on?
ketta and nkem got through it in 12 cubes, see if you're up for the challenge?
yes, did one cube earlier, then I had server problems. looking at chat, wondering if problems?
12 cubes...accuracy?
rut roh reb... not a good day?
One newbie question--Am I really contributing anything new, or am I still in training?
@maewaffle, you're getting the same cube again?
@db do you still have the check my work button?
whee, JS error. still interested in those?
amy have you been able to submit any?
when does the error show up?
it's barely loading for me but when I try to submit it just asks me if I'm sure and when I click yes it doesn't do anything
same here... why does it do that? I havent been able to get any points other than from the tutorial
what is supposed to happen after you hit "I'm finished"
...and what amy said :)
it was not connected to the original task?
is that...fast or slow?
whichc is...slow? 
Is everyone chatting here a dev for this project?
hmmm ok..why hasn't he done that
sure, do you know what time?
what is a mod if we have admin
como eu jogo isso?
i thought thats what admins were for lol
why doesn't the game tell my accuracy anymore?
but your work is compared to other player's work, and that's how it figures it out, basically
@nathan, did the refresh help?
Is anyone having issues with submitting after they've finished a cube?
hi someone here ?
did i pass?
echo, did you ever hear about something called "sleep"? :D
is it working now?
Still the submit stuff?
submit is still sporadically not working?
do you mean pressing the "check my work" button?
when i press it i can see the results with the red colors etc. but i dont get an overview for percentage, that box doesnt appear
when she comes in I'll work on fixing it
also, is there a reason why I started on practice 4 out of 6
Ok, is there anything I can help you with?
by redoing some tests?
can someone try a hard cache clear?
what should be tested?
can you check the js console? are you getting exceptions?
dom exception 11?
which omni.js line?
when pressing submit i get this: omni.js:134
test once more?
so only some people can't submit..?
in the initial tutorial too?
are you on eyewire.org or www.eyewire.org?
hate to ask this but does firefox work?
are you resetting the chat server?
that was happening with old code -- no chance it's cached?
But it it's the same
http://eyewire.org/static/js/omni.js?
Line 86
can I switch back to chrome? Firefox is soooo sloooow :D
Completely separate issue... do I need someone to set up a wiki account for me?  Because I get error messages trying to create one
wait nkem did you copy paste that or did you type it out?
or what line do you mena?
ok I knwo where the exception 11 is coming from
the line 86 one?
and because the *bling* has to be played before it's loaded, it won't show the score?
But isn't it odd, that it just started yesterday? With the new challenge?
what's interesting is this change existed on the test server for 3 days and none of my testers noticed it :(
Hm, maybe their connection was faster? Sound was loaded properly before use?
It also explains why only some people had the problem in "normal mode", when trying to submit
same for you all?
Those challenge cubes are kinda random, hm?
The order in which they appear and if they are progress-bar cubes or not?
progress bar is random?
were you nkem_test yesterday?
about an 90 minutes ago i had an issue when submitting cubes, i can now confirm that this has been solved
no, that is not, what I meant
Oh I see what you're saying
what's up, tatarana?
you mean SAC-challenge?
how did it go? :)
what is the SAC challenge?
the most I seem to be able to earn is 20 points. How do you score more than 20 points??
what is that supposed to mean?
is it that nobody has tried it yet or that nobody can do it?
yes?
So How do you get the training cubes for the starburst cell?
so did my messages about the bug get through?
when you click return to overview during  the transition between cubes
whoa you passed the test?
what test is that?
Does anyone think there should be a way to automatically turn the cube the right side up? I keep turning it upside down and not noticing it.
I am on the challenge: how will I get the next cube?
I'm still trying to use Blender's keys on the 3D model.  Is there a way to change the keymap?
echo, can you help me to go to the 2nd cube of the practice?
you can't get to it?
you guys are having issues in the tutorial?
@tripp, what were you on before?
tripp are you in the regular tutorials?
@tripp, go ahead and finish this piece and hit check my work, i want to see what happens
@gisela you are in the SAC tutorial?
same thing?
now, @tripp, are you having the same problem?
@tripp in your cube to you see a black segment in the 3D?
yeah. how did I do? I got 100you mean the parts that we shouldn't trace?
@crazyman what?
reb what about now
should I just continue? 
I was set back to 4 of 6 after submitting 6 of 6?
you're going backwards in time?
@reb are you still on the cubes with progress bar?
Wait, when I clicked "check my work" on practice 5, it told me I got 100tell me what cube you're on I'll see what order we're giving to you
maybe they are random? :)
ok Reb, echo just explained what's going on
we seem to be the Guinea pigs of this challenge. That's what I like about science
and it's everytime a different cube?
hang on gisela, it still says you're on 1 of 6?
is anyone else finished with the SAC tutorial online?
or crazy.. when you're on the SAC cell tracing
at bottom left under your name does it show your points?
seems you are already done without knowing? :D
Sorry, but it is always like this when I try something there is a bug
/motd THREE DAY STREAK! @crazyman4865 dominates the EyeWire leaderboard with 17,553 points! Are you advanced? Try the Starburst Challenge.
hmm so I should not go publicize the star challenge just yet? 
/msg amyleerobinson Is that a new one, again?
but? Isn't that what you want?
and now I go on as before?
How can we do the starburst challenge?
what's going on now
when I submitted, it added everything I had erased...
on which cell do we have to work?
echo: can you see the cube I am on?
but it's 1 pixel outside of what you can see
that is what I thought
Which cells are visible when you passed the Starburst challenge ? Don't know if I passed, with the problems yesterday.
so, 2000 is now maximum?
how do you get those....i must really suck, i mostly get 80s
which cell are you guys on?
where are you working on, crazyman?
no idea where can I see it?
and all of them for crazyman? :D
whats the bug?
? ? ? ketta messed up a cube, ketta messed up a cube ? ? ?
what?
was it a cell body?
echo what should I do D:
any final comments before I publicize the starburst challenge? :)
Get ready for server overload? :D
@nkem is the motd confusing?
or is this something else?
she means what we did yesterday, the SAC thing
how do I get the cube to zoom?
do you have a mousewheel?
3? sure 2 doesn't work?
->Whatthecode, how did you get it to work, I am on SAC#1 but have no progress bar or feedback
yeah, it did't work for me...I had already been on the cell though, i think. Does that matter?
Nope .. can't find it. :-( Let's see what review says.
89Alright -- we've added the cell #Starburst Challenge" -- who has what it takes?  ;)
Hmm .. @amy, I was playing on SAC #1 while it was renamed to starburst challenge, I can start over? :)
@rj tutorial still not working? are you in the star challenge?
Did you reset the challenge? There is no SAC or SAC inputs any longer :(
a5hm0r didn't you already finish yesterday?
@amy can't you even see the count to 6?
so you have to do the test again?
what is it called?
when I go to play I am able to maop
That's what the cell is called
oh, so it is still a test?
but, but... why won't the GrimReaper help me? *sniff*
it's a real cell, we're just seeing how you do on your own
No life vest ?
okay, so I got points but no percentage, what does that mean?
Did you finish the test?
means you made it through the tutorial/challenge (not sure what you're working on)
Once I'm a SAC Hero, will it announce it  on chat how awesome I am? :)
probably just a name color to start, I think that's what amy/echo said
amy did they say if/when they would generate more cubes? Sorry if I missed it.
when more players did them, I guess
That should happen automatically, or not?
I'm really not sure how that works
@ketta, yea we have to rach critical mass of people playing in order to spawn new cubes. Are you out of them?
hey how many people are doing the starburst challenge right now?
the test or the cell itself?
7+amy then?
TeamX needed 6 submissions on average, right?
@nkem yep..100what?
100So, what should I do now? :D Less thinking?
oh wait... as long as the piece I am not sure about is not going to touch a cube border, it is rather irrelevant, right?
?
/msg test?
mod tools? :)
hein?
@sarabc, you french?
You could go like "huh?"
but for me hein? says it all, and I guess you got it too!
is there somewhere to make a note if you think that AI included a piece of axon that it shouldn't have for the initial parts in the cube?
are they at least within the window? 
Easter egg?
threeth?
when doing the challenge
wtc, if you think getting 99What happend @crazyman?
@ketta: how was the excursion?
what excursion?
you went somewhere with students?
maybe someone else you're thinking of?
anyone on the starburst challenge? 
and why might that be?
Maybe call yourself JollyReaper?
that time of the month?
Something wrong @amy?
It's only uploaded after a certain amount of time or something?
ah, I see...do you know when they'll officially release it?
left or right. Skip the errorneous part (right) or keep it, since it doesn't touch the wall? :D
Hmm @nkem what do you need to know?
@nkem, but the right is your starting piece?
yea @wtc.. echo is out of town for a week...maybe when he gets back!
Did you know, that Luke Skywalker originally should be named Luke Starkiller? :D
don't you work?
yea star hero, it's to epic, stargazer..what is a good title for the starburst crew..
any body play minecraft?
I like how it says null cubes in the cell list for the starburst  challenge
star troopers? :)
K, ... moment of truth, I see how you could miss many branches on that last trial cube.
Guys, a note when you are tracing star cells: the branches almost ALWAYS extend all the way across a cube
To spawn cubes?
Well... as long as the cubes are really hard, we are still on a starburst cell, right? :D
I really have no idea, how you are already out of cubes. There still 4/10 to go for me. :/
I mean, yes, I am slow. But almost half your speed?
the white window showed like this afternoon, when echo had to repare
Is the spawn rate lower in the @SAC challenge?
so IM a stargazer now?
234 ... so seems like other people found it as well .. but did it spawn anything?
so, 9 more weeks, eh? :D
Whoa @crazyman you have only been a member for 1 week?
How did you discover eyewire?
are you sure it's immediate like that nkem? I thought more than one person had to come along to a cube before you got TB retro points
yeah, would be nice to know how that worked exactly
leaving again?
That's what she said.
Isn't The Office a family show? :)
how's lab and family life these days? getting any sleep?
@hsseung? But the growth of this SAC is too fascinating?
Whether it will work with the filter of the initial SAC challenge?
I fully believe you when you say that :)
You are hoping that we will get further this way?
hi brinkhm are you new here?
i dont' recognize crazyman's flag...what country is that?
@brinkham are you in high school? college?
oh goodie, because I get sad when I run out of cubes :P
why am i green again?
you too, I was just thinking of you the other day when one of my professors brought up DR
Would you take offense, if I tell you that I actually came here because you are using WebGL? :D
beisbol = baseball?
question: why am i green again?
@hsseung holy cells ! you? omg You're amazing haha :D!!! KEEP up the amaaziing job! and yeah you're harlem shake was epic ;)
@smly are you new here?
haha cool. :D you guys usually chat at this specific hour? 
Do you think, we can manage to freeze my connectome till... lets say 2040? There is some neat stuff that I would like to see personally :)
@smly do you mean the lab people or players in general?
you mean cryonics?
omg .. LOL it's 02:4am here ... X'D what's the time at your place guys? 
@smly ur in europe?
@wtc where are you located?
oh, I thought your flag showed Belgium once?
And before it showed a dutch flag, that's the country where I signed up.
Maybe we should start having eyewire player hangouts when we travel :) 
What are you visiting Nijmegen for?
good idea. what about Greece in July
hope, Rachel won't get a heart attack, once she checks out what we did during weekend...
@nkem you have new cubes now?
There are teams?
where do you see how many are left?
the awkward felling to hold a speech on TED talks?
what will you teach us?
did those messages pop up simultaneously, again?
@amy why TED? Why not .... any professional conference or something.
I mean, TED is great and all. But isn't it a bit more prestigious presenting on an actual neuroscience conference or something? :)
does this mean we're getting better? :D
@amyleerobinson where are you from? 
you are from where again?
Mauritius: is that not only for holidays?
i bet you don't know where mauritius is situated haha XD perhaps never heard of it LOL 
Starburst ninjas, maybe? :D
I just finished the first set of practice starburst cells, so now I'm on the second set. What does it mean when it says to trace around the
merger?
Might there be a gap?
(that was the one, where the merger connected to the cube wall)?
What do you mean by spawn a new cube?
Only 74? Must have missed a part. :-(
Dendrites are getting thicker! I guess we are heading in the direction of the cell? :)
Haha. Did we?
how do you know the direction
you see how the overview rotates?
when you finish a cube?
yes, can I change it?
according to what I just traced
uh-oh... no drinking and tracing? :D
So you can just sit back and watch it grow? :)
When I was a kid I would drink with the grownups ... it was called kiddibul or something.
you saw what?
Can't you give us a new challenge? :)
there were some days, when my son was little...he'd make the bathroom stink instead of the bath making him smell better
I know when summer arrives from the size of the dirt ring on the bath when they get out. That's my official summer call
oh nooo... I got a cube where the AI did everything correct
hm, it's the right branch of the cell (looking from where we started)
no joke there :) he's a teenager now and constantly eats. I know why, and I know he needs it, but it drives me crazy :P
@ketta, hmm why?
The top of that image, is where we are adding onto.
nkem: depends on how you look at it :)
From where we started, crazy :)
oh, c'mon. three cubes without doing something?!
? I mean the cubes
That's weird. :/ It comes together in 1 place, and then diverges again?
was this one click?
crazy?
do imgur and puu.sh work without a captcha?
Hey, wtc and gisela - you are not going to bed?
I thought it was a branching structure. :/ What's up with that.
?
wtc, i still don't see what you mean by "split and *merge*"
may I ask what you are discussing?  more cubes?
2 points, where 3 paths meet
Ah ... n/m, I know how to interpret it now. :)
And the main branch continues now in same direction opposite of where we came from.
Nah .. has to, remember the shape of a SAC?
not like the J-Cell, where the body was way above the branches
ah, sure?
Oh, how do we do the cell body?
Just outer region?
Depends on how 'blocky' it is. :)
When I first started this, I had some trouble with my computer not allowing me to "paint" by clicking. Suggestions as to why this is?
Safari 5.1? :D
was it the Safari-stuff?
firefox did that to me when I tried to use it (couldn't color)
seriously... how?! :D
However... there was once a "blahblah" in "How I met your mother"...
how?
So, seriously: How can you be that fast?!
@ketta, how does that help? :)
It tells here what pieces she has to add
the speaking part? I just mean I feel like I'm a natural at it
can you guys see the curvature?
what does trailblazing mean?
where's Grim?
isn't echo gone again?
for like...a week?
jamie - what did you color?
Only the outlines?
i do miss echo when he's gone... ninja dev, always fixing stuff when you least expect it
How long have you all been playing? Out of curiosity :)
you started with me?!
Some reason? :)
The games got to do something with it? :)
i don't know what the reason was
ha, gisela - again the chocolate? :D
Just curious: What do you think is the average age of the people playing this game? 
really?
you asked, what I think... but yeah :D
42 points! yeah, What could be better?
@ketta, when did you last check the overview? :)
well, i want to know where that 2000 poitn one is
Maybe new cubes are only assigned to accurate players? :D Those that get 2000 points for a cube or so...
how many times do you guys usually go back and forth to see if nothing is missing?
Me, always twice, where the second time is a different direction.
uhm alright... and did you ever get  cell that looked like it was perfect, nothing to do?
why is this so addictive?
When you start to color things in your dreams, you played too much...
grade school teachers?
yeah, you know, grade 1-6?
huh?
Hmmm .. what do you guys think about that structure that got added at the bottom?
Where we started?
Very likely merge error no? If at first we all missed it.
the entire bottom part looks like a misplaced limb.  new to this, is that likely a mistake?
Why does my original dark blue have yellow on it, on the left side before I begin?
hey, wtc. want to see a magic trick? :D
WHO WAS THAT?! :D
so maybe that is why it didn't get any points...
do you feel sometimes the blob it creates hen you click is bigger than you wanted?
but I assume you mean it is expanding beyond some walls?
i mean when you feel like theres a small apace to fill but when you click it expands to where it souldnt
Wait how much practice is there ;-;
is there another one you can put up? :D
who will moderate the moderators?
hey where does nkem live?
oh, he did? *grins*
nkem? This lazy boy is located in Germany, yes...
wait...what?
how that?!
that's what I said! :)
not sure when though!
just how are the points assigned anyways?
it's based on how well you do against work others have done on the same cube...
huh?
Hey Ketta, you part of this project? you seem to be very knowledgeable
how the heck did you guys get so many points!?!?
so  if a cube is blatantly wrong, is it kicked back for redo by someone else?
/me gniffles when reminded of ketta's unfortunate 2000-story.
the work that most submit is what the ai takes (law of averages, sorta)
what do the different color names represent?
@hsseung, aren't you suspicous of that segment that got added at the start of the SAC?
(where we started)
far from the cell body?  that's not a merger...it's the start of another cell
can't believe how fast this grew...and how accurately too
but you beat it, right?
kkk worried about me?
you guys know the goal right?  we are trying to find all SACs that connect to J-IFLS
we are trying to figure out how the J cell detects motion
what are SAC's?
SAC is starburst cells, right?
Haha I still can't believe IFLS won that. It's crazy what the internet can do when it puts its mind to something.
So..by knowing the connections, it will help you figure out how they detect motion?
she can see movement or moving things e.g. when biking.
So all of these connections we are making are helping your guys' research?
what is the estimated number of work hours needed for your next goal?
how old is your daughter?
did you start writing already?
it's known for sure that the problem is in her retina?
makes sense (when you see the cell)
yes, we did a scan with contrast in anestetic when she was 3y
what do the doctors say is wrong with her retina?
oh i had never heard of that condition...associated with albinism?
what does it mean when someone trailblazes a cube?
but will we still have things to map after the paper?
your daughter's skin has no pigment?
@ketta interesting, how does it affect your vision?
@hsseung I've already said I'd donate mine to science..they're a little messed up, but you never know what you might find :D
really?? I'll have to read that later...saved it for now
is it possible for me to choose which cell to do?
Im not sure i know the name of what im doing now
Ive always wondered, is cool ranch really "cool"?
Another 6 practice cubes? I had a 97 average!
were all of them 90+?
Would this research have any connection to retinitis pigmentosa?
What's it doing?
When you start over does it give you another cube?
There used to be a give up button, but I forget what it was called.
which ones do you skip?
I see. It rotates to a different orientation when I start over.
any admin/mod around?
hello?
how do you like it so far?
how long have u been playing
@nkem did they mess up?
but yeah, what wtc said
What's the latest scoop? :)
We are tracing multiple cells within the "Starburst Challenge"?
yeah?
So, the coloring is not automatically assigned?
do you all know each other...?
??
Amy is the mouth piece to the external world. Is that correct to say?
?
wait, you're all waiting for me?
yes...?
Why is my name green again?
/msg ketta you know, laurcifer is laure bersig? :)
maybe...lavender?
you mean like this?
how u do that
it's from when echo was messing with colors :)
How would team x have called the cell if we'd have won? :)
@wtc I asked once...and it would have been something similar to IFLS, but I can't remember what they were thinking
what's wrong?
@ketta, found your 2000 cube yesterday? :)
@hsseung, how unfortunate, at your age.
why are u yelow 
What colour am I
what wtc said :)
mastermind?  or godfather
Or the connectomaster?
370 pts = SAC bouton?
how bout just calling him overlotd
20 points theking?
what?
was wondering what was wrong :)
how u get the grey writing
@ketta, you whining about your 2000 cube AGAIN? :)
did it wofk?
PhD?
when are you done with your phd?
who?
but one problem is that we don't know how many there are until we find them
Ahhh .. so it's 500 identified synapses, but most likely only 50 of them lead to SACs?
furget what i said
how is u
What are you getting a PhD in, if you don't mind me asking?
So i know you can zoom in the 2D view, but can you pan?
Desktop metaphor?
what are the grey areas of the cell?
ugh...just found a merge error and spent a lot of time finding where the right bis continued...
still just 40 points, but I'm pretty sure what I did was good
Who dropped this one on the floor?
How are we expected to work in conditions like this!
what exactly would the revolt be based on?
more cubes?
but it would probably based on how much work you do (commission style) and we'd all end up hating each other :P
I wonder how you can slightly drop something
drop it from a low height? :P
you get caught tracing?
What? No I don't dare open up eyewire at work. :) 
why work when you can play? :)
how do you trailblaze??
that's why I'm putting myself through school :P
They exist, but you don't always know what you really want to do
Well .. that's up to you isn't it? :)
yes, you dont alway know what you want to do
I know perfectly well nowadays what type of jobs I like and which I don't.
By that I mean you might start a job you love3 and later realize it's not what you want
Crazyman about how long does it take you to do a cube?
Whoever asked what that grey was in overview.
discontinued?
Like they can't be traced?
Anyone knows what that is? :)
?
Do you have to get a certain Or maybe it's that way?
So if you get 100Or women tend to be 'orderly' ... and they want to attempt ordering this neuron mess? :)
So high? :)
But that's with casual gaming and all right?
Yup. For games that's true, I just wonder how it is in my classes.
I only played on PS2, almost failed a class because of how addicted I was
Where you have to 'build' your base (neuron) and expand it.
blowing up competitor's neurons?
Well .. or conquering them by being more accurate? :)
why does the color always changes?
@anitram, which one?
Leftovers from christmas? :)
@ash, you did all the cubes in the SAC challenge? :)
Good or bad for their hypothesis? :)
Alright, so I should just delete this piece that merges?
@limefox, you can leave it in if it makes it more obvious how they 'connect'.
@wtc what are you coding?
I think it already looks cool! :) http://whathecode.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/time_line_push_labels.png?w=620&h=348
Is there a way to see your stats?
?
are you working on the challenge Patricia?
the practice for the SAC? Those are definitely difficult :)
But how do you know...
and later, when you're tracing unknown neurons, your score is kind of an indicator for how well you're doing
ran out?
are the grey ones those that were locked?
so the available cubes in a cell is total - amount you completed?
You cant say that Current size - "what you did" = available
if your name is purple are you staff?
Thats why it grew by 217 cubes but is only 142 cubes in size :D
and what are cyan names?
how long do we have to wait?
that's what I do
did both of you try a hard refresh to see if that worked?
is there a daily score record?
still?
how long has this "game" been going public?
how many J cells do we have left?
I thought it was on the blog where the game scores were
echo or hsseung are you around? ...I know echo's out for a while, but he's still logged in
hmm?
ah, how many are out?
how are you guys feeling about starbursts now, more confident?
ok, so working around mergers, is that the best thing you learned from the tutorials?
you mean like a 'maybe' color?
hm.. could you put "make top menu links open in new tab" on the to-do list too?
that's where middle mouse button comes in
Oooooh, I dunno why I thought it didn't -- 
felt kinda stupid when I discovered it...'where have you BEEN all this time, magic button?'
what is the middle button?
/me is mouse-free -- is there a kb shortcut for that??? 
https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=157179
maybe it's an addon?
hey jamie, we were talking about the SAC challenge, what the best thing people learned from it
mate?
aaah, I know what you mean now jaimie (duh)
we swayed you from coffee?
did you see my question in the forum... maybe?
sarabc why wait until you're sick? :D
is making it cathartic?
because when I'm sick...I don't like making things ><
playing eyewire?
what are you studying ketta?
my husband is the best of his year in tech college (don't know how you call it in the sates)
really? that sounds interesting..
yeah, it was legend of the green dragon or something?  There was some sort of customizable online game thing
tt?
I feel old. When I graduated, my high school had just installed their first computer lab.
OMG there's a GOT talbe top?
how did I not know this?
because you weren't prepared for the awesome yet?
seen the show?
you're going to cook for your party?
wondered what constituted viking food... blood of one's enemy and roast goat?
I found where i can get some bugs btw :P I'd try it someday
heat as human heart? or just like beef heart?
i think in the cook book it's buffalo heart?
what's the weirdest thing you've eaten?
crunchy?
taste like... chips? the pepper on it?
yep, seen those, but I can't figure what's too eat in it
muktuk as in raw seal?
?
like what we call here 'oreille de christ'
where are you from sarabc?
is it bad I want to try it? :P
Where maple syrup is made
sugar shack is at this time of year, when we go where they harvest maple water and turn it into maple products and eat trad food
don't thay have it like in maine and around there?
where are you furball?
Furball: out of the ountains, is there even some forest?
i like snow when i don't commute on foot/bus
what sort of mistakes?
did more open up?
Whats jinseops task? He never chats :D
He is the other GrimReaper, right?
alquem do brasil?
how goes it r_oliver... liking the tutorials?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMkzdn2TDuI
alas, when I was passing through Germany again I tried to order that at a restraunt and my accent is not very good
I can see why...it takes a while to figure them out sometimes
feels good when you do figure it out...
what's that @ketta
does that make sense?
that's why I was like 'goo crazyman!
what!
what was your score @ketta?
26 or 27k+? I think
What @kettta, awesome score!
how's the star tracing going? 
yeah amy out of cubes and I haven't heard from Jinseop on what to do about it
does it say how many have done it?
I think there is something fishy around my cube.  a merger?  #48376
That means you confirm some of our "suggestions" by hand?
this means i help where you got stuck
what caused that, btw?
what does that green branch mean in SAC?
green branch, in your cube?
you guys have more cubes now, right?
a green one eh?
Has someone looked at my cube with the mistake? Can I leave it?
how?
for now, depends how fast you guys are :p
i dont know why
do you record some stats about us?
like what?
We have that data but haven't figured out how to query it yet
How do we know if we are one of the 34 ppl who have unlocked level 2?
UROP?
did you go through the SAC challenge?
no, I am not sure, what a UROP is :D
ok guys, i've finished what I can do for now
how many cubes does this challenge has?
And look how he is doing now :D
25000 points in one day ?? this is madness.
Does that mean we get double points for all cubes or just the sunburst?
@ crazyman thats what i thought too!
is this project analyzing the brain of only one person currently?
Hi - can one of you tell me how to turn off the chat window? It's kinda distracting for me today!
percentage wise, how much has been done?
close = a few weeks maybe?
what algorithms have been used beforehand?
if we get double points for this, does it means that it can go up to 2000?
How are you supposed to tell if you have the 2k point cell?
alreayd out of cubes.. we need some sort of real time reader to show how many people are actively playing
I wonder how many active users there is, out of the hundreds that registered.
hmhm?
do you keep this tiny part? 
If I click every single place I can in a cube, do I lose points? Haha.
I hate when they go hair thin and you know it should go on but can't flg it properly
were you still going to do a name color or something for that?
..and btw, how's your weekend going...fun time at the party?
I'd thought about it. What do you all think, we have so many colors in chat but we could maybe add a birghter or pastel purple
whatchall think about colors for people who have achieved star level? We kinda decided at the lab not to do that
so you can see, how it is possible, that the leading persons have so many points
haha what's that from ketta
seems like there should be plenty of people working on the SAC challenge to keep it going though...?
I do not understand: only 35 on the challenge?
@crazyman crap -- we're sorting out why the spawner is behaving strangely
how do you disable chat
what?
1-2px connection likely? :D
/msg rprentki Could you take a look at it, please? :)
test?
I CAN'T GET OVER 20 POINTS, WHY?
Is there anybody, that can help poor nkem? :(
maybe?
whre is that screen shot?
how can you tell if you did a good job?
can you show the other side of it?
which is what we might have here
maybe so?
no 2d can help too, especially at the exact point where it might go wrong
huh? but I added all two possible paths :D
well, the greebish one is you right? and the yellow orange is the AI?
greenish? woah, you have a strange monitor :D The huge orange part is mine
any other call?
lower is the one that stops?
did I help?
yeah, of course. Thats why I said 3:0 :D
see, you did what I should have :P
Was that ever disputable? :D
So, I think that trailblazing is a little funny in SAC... you get 100 instead of 50, but when you get your TB retro points...
let me know what you guys think when you can catch your TB scores
you think? because it never happens on regular scoring
did the site go down?
what's that green branch?
in the overview?
there are more?
yeah...that's exactly what I've been seeing off and on, throughout today
the gray are growing parts aren't they?
or is it?
no?
can't remember what rprentki said
does this makes sens?
but the shape of it?
well, when the reaping crew gets on, I'm sure we'll find out what's going on :P
reaping?
no cubes?
a poll real quick how many people are working (or would work if they could) on the SAC?
@ketta yeah I see it, but i'm trying to figure out why there are no cubes first :p
a question, when's the last time anyone had cubes for the SAC challenge?
@ketta do you have star cubes?
When it says "try to trace around the merger," what exactly does it mean?
So a merger is an AI mistake?
is that in a tutorial?  
but why are you playing while you also could sleep? :)
SAC still having problems? bummer...
in j-5?
or are there more now?
only 12?
is it just me or have the cubes become easier than when we started
why yes...yes it is :)
and you had to say that on this...?
don't care what you say, I'm not going outside!
outwhat?
wazzat?
outa cubes hate it when that happens
the ladies ask me why im so smooth
mckenna trees?
yeah?
the 1k seems to be where you fill in the giant blobs
ur last names king!?
?
mom? 
what!!??
crazyman...? </3
who?
ok...?
why arent you going ham...?
ham?
BACON?
haha thats what i was thinking...
so hard to decide: mapping or chat box?
Too many people partying?
just say when :)
and until when?
not sure...i guess you guys are enjoying it?
so there are two reasons why we run out of cubes
its confusing when th lines are thin
yes when the branches get thin we are stopping prematurely
false positives and false negatives? :)
the problem arises when many people make the same mistake
yes...last night some were sharing screens and asking what others thought
is there a code to assign the cubes which ppl disagree more often? to increase the sample size?
not yet.  but that's not the main problem.  the problem is when ppl agree and are wrong!
when ppl make the same mistake
@hsseung, then what was it during the eyewire games that team x had to revisit cubes less often?
@wtc not sure what you mean
yeah - I just wanted to explain what wtc meant :D
@hsseung, didn't encounter many stopping ones, only when you get a 'corner' they might not go on.
I do wish we could peek in on each other's cubes (like a mutual agreement feature?)
to share info...'hey, what did you do here?'
you really want me looking over your sholer all the time, ketta? :D
did you guys look at J cell #5?
yeah...been working on it when there are no cubes in SAC
Whars SAC!?
@hsseung, any idea what it could be?
hm, J Cell 5 looks more like OSGC #3?
woooooow... Maybe call it Seung cell? :)
do you see how the dendrites of J Cell 5 are somewhat concentrated in two parallel planes?
yeah, it's what made me compare it to an acacia tree, sorta
i think that's why nkem made the comparison to OSGC#3
lizard spock?
ditto?
So, how would a neuroscientist finally determine, what type of cell it is?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iapcKVn7DdY
exciting isn't it?
nobody knows how many types of cells are in the retina
@hsseung, what does 'green' mean in the overview?
location where cubes are being spawned or something.
@hsseung, would ppl with ocular diseases have dif cells?
here's an attempt at a catalog: http://openi.nlm.nih.gov/detailedresult.php?img=3171878_tjp0589-3691-f1&req=4
anyways isn't it crazy how complicated the retina is?
they only see in two colors, right?
Need help here pls: any trick to recover the 2D image while 3D is OK? It vanishes from time to time. Thanks.
so..in a mammal that sees in color, like we do, how do you think the neurons in the retina would differ?
it vanishes? One slide is sometimes there and sometimes not?
right...so I'm curious if there are more of one kind, more DIFFERENT kinds, or...??
and less than a frog? :)
I watched the video ?Amy? linked on facebook
i meant the neurons like we're working on (but I see what you mean)
Could there be errors on the original dark blue we are given?
@seung I'm most interested in behaviors behind mimicking, so that could be really interesting, what your friend is doing
does birds also have mirror neurons? does nyone have an idea?
Why else would they try to aim for our heads ... because they do have empathy. ;p
how can I click this link? :)
the NS cell?
aww, how kind of you :)
so... blackblues, did you manage to copy it?
Sometimes you have to click again on this darker bar below, where you type your texts
is it because of the browser?
what are you using?
so it works from chrome but nor firefix?
I am sure, you don't see the date, you joined?
says something like undefined NaN?
hm, that works for you on Firefox?
? can select!
btw can you send the article link again?
mirror neurons?
why?
How come?
ah, it's because the cubes seem to be reopened?
and we're not sure why
you can continue to play if it's working - -are you able to continue playing?
How many people are there now working on SAC?
How do you tell how many you have?
able to figure out what it is yet with echo gone
does that mean it's working?
Guess how many cubes are submitted to eyewire each hour?
5000?
@crazy are you out of star cubes, too?
than why the j?
He's what you could call a completionist. :)
how does it feel to be blue ash :D
Are SAC players a different color? I've lost track of what the colors mean, it seems like they keep changing. ;)
What do the different colors mean? I know yellow is admin, but after that...
I was wondering what was up with the colors, too
Awesome, thanks a bunch! What are mods? Haha sorry
Does it really matter??? I'm just enjoying this, no matter what color...
Do we need to be kept in LINE?  What are we a bunch of misfits that needed to be kept int line?
sometimes when there is a huge influx of new players, we get a few gems
newbie here. the tutorial seems to have finished & i have 3 buttons: skip, restart & finished. doing the real data now?...
That's where I am.
When I get bored, I take a break and play tetris.
so you end up dreaming about filling dropping squares?
work today eh?
it's saint patrick's day, that must mean you're a lepperchaun?
heh, what's the coldest you've ever been in furball?
C? of F?
lower than -20?
our office heating system is messed up too. Says it's +25, no matter what it really is.
which is way too hot when heating
and can't be set over +25.. so the heat doesn't come on when it needs to
I had one Christmas break where it didn't go above 0F the entire 3 weeks, the high one day was -27C
lol, did you try to put ice on it, so the heat would go ?
I want to trailblaze a cube.  How is that done?
Nobody knows?
Okay, I *did* wish for more complexity. Now I've got one of the staticky ones where the neuron ends up looking like a tall stack of pancakes
Switch them how, Sarabc?
Ohmygoodness, how did I not know that? Thanks!
wait, starburst challenge is off the list?
I'm sure it'll be up soon (Amy?)
should i leave it then?
You won't kick us out, will you? I've got a really good one going!
and I finally figured out what the green color is in the 3D overview
what is it?
as in, newly traced or newly introduced cubes?
I had all the cubes done and when I came back the new ones were in green
and rprentki didn't know right off what they were
oh, Starburst was removed after all?
Hm..I'm not sure what happens if you still play once it has been removed. 
j5? you mean... snc1 8-)
Hi, where has level 2 gone?
When they are fixed, it will come back
In doing a J cell now, I realised how much more difficult the other are.
So, has crazy completed the starburst while I was away or has something else happened?
so it's back to standard cells?
yes. where is the challenge?
is anyone else getting cubes where the AI is like 98then what? :p
is there other cells ready to be worked on Amy?
where did the starburst challenge go?
hair troubles ladies????
@ketta did you get to choose your username color?
is the top scoring team /team topscore?
how are they doing on the SAC...did we totally break it?
now what am I going to do 
is anyone else out of cubes?
@ketta do you have cubes?
that is what routinely happens to top scorers - you can't sustain those scores over days because you literally run out of cubes to do
@jamie is out too? 
last thing I saw was from Jamie about how we have so many people to work and not enough work to do
hmm, stats for cells break when you have no available cubes
is anyone besides @crazyman nearing 0 cubes on J5?
don'you work or study?
a day?
no courses?
high school? college?
i just started how are you
what happens with the other cells that are not being worked on?
what kind of dev?
android app would be cool - if you could play offline (this takes so much bandwidth I think) and upload or something when not mobile?
how dose the light blue work??
@kitkat light blue name is when you were the top scorer the day before :)
how are you
I'm fine :) You ?
how do you trailblaze a cube?
so when you are out of cubes not only the stats are broken 
me?
anyone else say bob?
ketta?
s'ok, why the 101?
why bob?
what, in oculos
thats what i meant
bye....?
Can there be errors in the original dark blue we start with?
yes...usually merger errors. What are you seeing?
has the SAC cell gone?
Ketta, how do I know when I,m done with the cell?  Is the progress bar specific for each player?
@maryjoy are you in the tutorial?
ok, are you talking about the progress bar in the overview when you're looking at the cells?
as in, how close the cell is to being complete
Do people get the same segments? Or different for each?
depends on how well they agree with each other
to make sure its correct?
ketta, are you like, the maker of this?
how often do you come across a piece that needs no changes? 
it's more like I'm a good parrot...just repeat what I hear and learn from the yellow people :P
what cell do you recommend Ketta.. something gnarly please
Real newbie question here:  Are these neurons in the retina or in the brain?
25Might this research have any connection to retinitis pigmentosa?
beacuse i make one mildly big mistake? xD
I always wondered what animal cell we are working on, though I thought it really was a mouse - sacrifice for the sake of science
you can look on the blog and the wiki for great info about what the research is about :)
What is SAC (do not read blogs nor wiki)
How do you take out data that you find that is obviously random and false?
it's the starburst cell (I still can't remember what the a stands for...)
Where do you find them?
in the game? there aren't any up atm
How are you?
now is when patience is neede
c'mon ketta, where's the trick? :D
sac is back?
So right now we are pretty much just going through this to sharpen up the AI system?
different J cell #4's?
the one you get by defaut when you log
do have other cells ready?
Coool... somehow I thought it would put me on the newest one automatically?
how's the SAC cell?
yeah... what a bummer!  the one you want the most!
Is it normal on some blocks to get barely a stub and have to add LOTS of little pieces?  I feel like I'm going down a rabbit hole sometimes.
hold shift and zip up and down.. gives you a good chance to look at what is happening
and follow the branch you're on ... just to see what looks right
check out this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HarpGSmvPns
what are the yellow balls?
from this?
No, I know, ends and edges.  Still, 20?
It's like Whose Line is it Anyway?
The shoe where the games are amde up, and the points don't matter!
have you read how points are calculated?
I have read it - It makes me wonder how many people clicked on that one a few times, and then just submitted it
@christie when your work compares well to what others have done, it means more points (as well as volume filled in)
pts are how they addict you
What methods are used to acquire the 2D scans? MRI?
Ok, so I've kinda figured if I work hard on a cube and end up getting 20 points I totally messed up somewhere....sound ight?
what is trailblazing?
with no mistakes? or just a new cube?
you'll get better with practice :) have you seen the videos on the blog?
has anyone ever gotten a cube where most  of it is already filled in by the computer? it takes up so much of the cube it makes filling in
What's with all these little runty neurons that don't seem to go anywhere?
que?
aww, what a good cube to start the day :D
How is your cube?
isnt that a spice?
colic?
I wonder why I have to reload the page twice after enabling scripts before the chat works.
Any admins on atm?
How long has eyewire been around?
when I saw so many new cubes I thought we might have a second cell again 
/msg ketta Heatmap only for us? :D
/msg ketta It was below the "Welcome to EyeWire" message. A "heat map". But I lost it, when I started a cube :(
Did all the tutorials - aced one or two and totally flubbed others...  and feel like I need more training.  is there a place on site?
what are typical newbie mistakes when mapping? 
shouldn't we tell someone about the 2nd cell that showed up on J 5?
and the videos for cubes you did in the tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6ENAPXN9Lc&list=PL-IggV222ozRiKUehYTkFaW1T5rQ1iChs
rpretnki are you around?
Anyone found the error point already?
Here?
Have you seen OSAC #1?
What's up with that one?
must have happened overnight when they added/opened more cubes or something
like separating conjoined twins?
work on merger in j5 or not?
are those on all cells?
any chance you can poke rprentki or any other Grimreaper type?
Not sure I do - what does that mean?
@amy always wondered if in that case the data is collected and used or its a wast of time to work on mergers?
(May I selfishly also point to my (not fully answered) question in the forums?) :D
yes, if you see a discinct merger I think you can type /debug and it will tell you what cube you're on
mhh is it new that you can't open forum in a new tab? with mousewheel click?
or is my browser messed up?
we just have to bug echo when he gets back (lol nkem)
@nkem on merge errors?
How does the AI 'see' the slices to work out where to color in?
(and where I can clearly tell from the overview that the cube belongs to the wrong cell)
basically if you see what you think is a merger, type /debug and report it to support
Does that answer what you were asking?
As you said, it is lost when the Reaper takes care of it. Ok?
so the reaper is the entity that merges the data and sees what to select as correct?
Was my point understandable?
So, you would say: "Ignore it, simply fill in the cube and submit to get your points"?
there is then another problem as the team isn't online 24/7 (at least i hope^^) and there are a lot of people who play when it's night in MA
ohh I see what you're saying
or: does the AI value "not extend" and "someone extended" identical?
That's what I hope (but guessed)
So I'm working on a cube now where I think the AI has made a mistake what slould I be doing?
Can you clearly see the "correct" path?
i'm new to this, any tips?
lefarrell, did you already start the tutorials?
And any specific problems so far? :)
Is Al always correct?
ok, would you like to place that in the forum?
@nkem, yep, when we trace from multiple seeds, such as in the eyewire games, it can be very hard to ID mergers
so, a merger is the unlikely event that the AI puts two cubes together in an erroneous juxtaposition?
is it just me or the 3D model is very clumsy?
@kintr it gets smother when you zoom in and wait
?
Even in the SAC challenge, crazy?
OMG - ALT drag in 2D - COOL!  How would I have known about that?
Is there a place to find more of these great key shortcuts?
try the ? sign left corner
Yay, the grim reaper passed by?
/me wonders why nkem is happy
wtc?
I am bored. Is there an interesting cell to work on?
???
Yes?
is ketta here?
Life was so much easier when everyone on internet was male.
Team Science?
wait... the*king*critic is also female?
when exactly was it that everyone on the internet was male?  I have been communicating by computer since I was at MIT back in 1978.
?
<- w or m?
what does that mean?
<- w or m?
what?
<- w or m?
wat u find?
@thekingcritic why?
/msg whathecode Steven? :D
/me wonders what to write next
a rough teardrop shape hat seems to be riding pickaback prolly an error?
what?
what?
what?
One mistake? :) Try googling whathecode. ;p
Are the results still PG?
long thin line, with rough teardrop shape resting along it, prolly a goof?
prolly?
did you check another orientation of the cube?
How young are you? :)
I use big science words?
I might be 10 years younger than what wtc said :D
huh!?
or would he?
Perhaps an 11 year old tracing neurons would? :)
(why does everybody do that)
what is wrong with my keyboard!!
If I think about it... is harper a girls name only? :D
yes....?
@rinda hmm?
u live in germany!?
@ashmor, is that snow'storm' also hitting Belgium tomorrow?
wind has knives?
@thekingcritic, ain't there snow in other states of USA? E.g. Vermont.
Snow in NY? :) Isn't that rare? 
what time is it there king
how bout u
woah, you are so badass :D (Is that correct slang?)
You should listen to her. Still enough time to ignore her when you hit puberty. :)
in the evening?
why is it 10 pm?
so, I'll keep calling you... anitram?
is the starburst challenge finished?
where?
or in a cube?
how do you find the ID 
where can you see the identity number?
is there anyone to look into the merger?
Hmm ... these AI merge errors could be reduced if the AI would stop when those 'lines' occur.
thats what we are doing
so, do we get our names published in a journal when this is done? :P 
all five K or more?
thats how they check our work
?
But I imagine they can't publish them all, so don't know how they'll manage.
What do you mean I can't suspend my computer with Eyewire running and have it work perfectly when I get back? :P
How many days has he been in the lead?
What are the dark areas shown on the slices?
within a blob?
small points?
Now I have to go look up what that means : )
are you guys lagging? 
but why not fill in everything? 
i thought mapping everything would be helpfull. thats why i do it
how're you nkem?
assistant for what class?
how'd you like it?
whats your normal schedule? :D
see - jbjaeger knows how it's done :D
ketta?!
Did you do something funny today?
Something that is worth to comment on?
funny? no...just been studying for finals and playing
so SAC not fixed yet?
Is this real, or is it an error?
Should I fill it in?
@ketta, can you look at cubes?
Should I click away, or open in a different window?
hello?
any developpements on the sSAC challenge?
we're figuring out what went wrong
is it a total bust rprentki?
oh?
how?
oh, we can do that?
so far it's only when you come across them in your cube
how does it work?
wait, was your question about the how they find the merger or how the AI makes them?
about how we can flag them to you
Merger?
a merger is when two things are attached that don't belong
that will be really good for when we find them in SACs because those are tough to do anyway
@ketta, that's an interesting idea, having you guys flag areas where you can't figure out the right answer
and we send that how? through the forum?
@hhooveszimmer, have you checked out the forum?
just deselect the segment and reselect, then the last segment ID (also available when you /debug) will be there too
Which cell is the most "important" or "urgent" A.K.A, which one would you like players to work on the most?
you've finished the tutorial then?
how many neurons on in this project?
is j-6 just around the corner? *ducks*
how about all total?
ccolbert--I'll have to check for you when I go back to the lab tomorrow, brain fart
of what?
it's very cool...I'm always comparing them to what I see in nature
So, what are the official names of your professions/specialty?
It's funny how the smallest missing piece and unveil a whole new branch.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI4MPF_IVlc
oh man, have you guys heard of the band fischerspooner?  great music for eyewiring.
when i listen to music and trace it's definitely enjoyable
what movie?
I guess my chatty daughters just make me feel like silence when I trace
That moment when a small cube is already solved by the AI. D:
how's it interesting?
spring=when you can see the grass through the snow
summer = sun (a good bit where I am) and sometimes rain
spring = when the almonds bloom
@furball weren't you talking about snow and hockey last time?

you know one thing my husband said when he arrived, is that we forget to tell strangers how beautifull it is when it snows
Eh?
maple syrup, eh?
what"s snow?
when I was little my parents took me to visit my grandparents who lived where there wasn't snow
is it that white stuff at the bottom of the Sequoias?
the one I just did had two loops on it... is that normal?
do you still have it up hangman?
@sarab, need me to check?
but there is a section in the forum called "Help What is This"
if you post a screen shot in there people will help you figure out what's up
exchanging information and all?
and check it out in the 3D, everything looks pretty smooth right?  that's a good indication it's right.  I can see it looks good without
can I hit finished? do you still need me on it?
oh, any suggestions for the SAC tutorial when we put it back up?
is there a way to explain that it flows if it's good? 
hmm..not really, other than putting up infor for submitting cube #'s when thre are nasty merge errors
I get the impression it's pretty frustrating when people don't realize that
:) Cool! Yeah I know when I started playing I didn't really get that concept for a while
we had that in our original tutorial but it's sort of a hard concept to grasp when you're first starting out/until you scroll fast enough
what I do then is just left the merger out, the scroll until you find alle the cell and come back to put the merger. I use this flow to get 
sometimes i leave the merger in and see what comes out the other side and then erase
@sarabc what convinced you finally?
when they were desinging eyewire they asked us lab worker bees if we really needed it
I'm brand new at this. just started last night... are there cubes that require no fixing?  been through this cube twice and can find nothing
that can happen sugarbuzzing, are you in the tutorial?
hey smalljude, before you came on we were talking about the SAC tutorial, and ideas/comments about it?
anything you liked in particular/would change?
except when I hit - move on after just loading a cube :P  got 0wait, you're doing this on a tablet?
how do you scroll?
so... you can't scroll and mark at the same time... have to move away?
i had a dream a while back where we were all playing eyewire on those big futuristic clear screens, using our hands like you do
like you have basically a frame, and it has laser sensors, and it can tell where you touch the air in the frame, and it translates
how's the SAC cell?  still broken?
a question, do you guys tend to keep the  EM plane in the 3D with the images?  do you keep it opaque or clear?
EM plane?
@smalljude, we have an idea of what's up, balkamm is trying to figure out how to prevent it in future
ah, i see what you mean
you guys all know about alt+drag?
whole new world when I learned that one!
is it possible to switch planes with a click, rather than alt-dragging?
nice, do you have a q hangman or are you bragging?
I'm bad at alt-dragging.. make myself dizzy, then end up where I started anyway :(
slow and steady until it's where you want it
why does it always start on the second layer?
then I go too little, and it doesn't go anywhere. can I use my "I'm a girl, we don't do computer games" card here? :)
have you ever had the 3D view be waaaay far away/off center?
Right click drag?
not sure what that would equate to in button clicks though
when did our colours change?
colors for what?
um, poo I don't remember how to do it
harass amy next time you see her?
smalljude, you still on?
rprentki couldn't remember how to change smalljude to purple
does she have to join mod team?
how's your day been?
it has been good, thanks how has yours been!
in that order? :)
what should i do if the computer doesn't show me what is already painted for some reason?
Is there a way to get back to the cube I was working on before my browser misunderstood me and went to another page?
Well, that was better than last time.  It'd be nice to see what others did after I'm done.
There is a lump on my AI 3d that by the scan I don't think should be there.  Suggestions?
note the cube number and send message to support? Screenshot?
Where do I find the cube number?
a little box didn't appear?
do you have pop-ups disabled?
that's very strange, do you have pop up disabled?
Is there some reason my submit button isn't working? 
hard refresh or close brower? I use chrome, know it works best for most people
how are you. and you good at this game
Everything seems to be working fine, but when I click submit, it acted as though I had clicked cancel.
who doesn't love bacon?
where r u
how are you
alright, and yourself? :)
nice. how come starving? they don't feed you in there? 
so what are you doing and it is ok I will eat in like 30 minutes lol
which country? it's almost 8pm where i am.
I live in the US. Where do you live
ah of course. whoa, crazy time difference. how come you're on eyewire then?
?
Did you see there is a new J cell up??! Woo!
there is?
how are you
starburst still broken?
so all you do is scroll up and down till your done?
how do you find all the pieces?
whats up animal lover?
@crazyman were you top scorer yesterday? Did i miss a day or have I juse confused myself?
Was @hangmanwa7id top scorer yesterday?
how is everyone today
AWESOME! How are you?
am I the only one working on the new cell? :D
how do you erase pieces?
?
Did anyone submit a bug report of this problem?
@animal what post do you mean
we don't know what post you are talking about
where are your posts?
does anyone have a problem submitting?
i haven't been on much today...was it working well earlier?
hey crazy, was ketta on earlier?
Amy was saying that people were having trouble submitting?
persons here who can't sumbit and using an skript blocker?
ketta?
yes?
because im using one and since some weeks there are some skripts more on the page and one is loading when you submit
What? 20 points for that?
Oh boy. That was an easy one. :O Don't see how people could miss those pieces.
not sent to bed yet?
who?
Error?
at overview, does it say how many cubes you have...more than 0?
Oh so you didn't actually finish them yet?
@ reb what do you mean?
cubes available?
wondering if it's a 'real' error. Does it show you have "cubes available"?
waht do you have at j5?
email support? restart browser? sorry, no ideas
acida, do you trailblaze cubes often?
number shouldn't change in this case, but will it let you play?
what is the support email?
what?
what?!
some evenings I wondered why they could talk so much
 im mostly on to check chat, so its dissapionting when theres nothing
why not :)
After I submit, I have to refresh to have a new cube.  is it normal?
A chatty player... no idea where to get such a thing...
Say... would you find it annoying if there would be a message when hitting submit with something like that:
"Are you sure about that branch? Many players didn't add it"
or "Are you sure, there is not missing a branch at this position"?
Maybe only the first score could count officially?
Because lately I saw some cubes where I added a branch that others missed (and probably I missed something others found)
how have you been ketta?
:o 508? What?
plymouthdave still here?
or another one having trouble with the "submit" button?
scacleve here?
this is happening in multiple browsers. anyone else experiencing this?
what?
what what what? :D
Are you on Chrome?
Hm, next time you try Chrome, could you hit CTRL+Shift+J to open the developer console, please? :)
especially when there's a lot of people on
and look if there is an error in the "Console" tab?
OK maybe it's a temporary blip. it actually only started for me today when i used this in chrome for the first time
where? what'S the console tabok so if i have that open, when i'm playing it should tell me if an error occurs?
Yes, when you encounter this specific one again, look for an error. I suspect something like "DOM Exception 11"
?and we put it somewhere on the forum
You just ran into this "cant submit" error?
that's exactly what's happening to me.
@davis: you just tried to submit and it didn't work?
And got this error?
That's what it did to me.  I just hit start over and it added my points.  Now it is working
ok... another strange question. Are you playing with sound or did you disable it (the speaker on the lower right of your screen)?
someone got that error with sound turned off?
I have sound off, and been submitting fine all day (that make you happier nkem?)
i have no idea what that means
want me to turn the sound off and try it?
I think, yours was already off?
If you know how, you could also try to clear your browser cache :)
No further complaints? I think, I can my shoulder for that one :D
tehn why was it still buggy?
how dare he
what does trailblazed mean?
just what I was thinking
what i was thinking is that it's fun cause it's a game, and you get points.
we get paid?
402,000 points for free?
would it still be as addicting?
why not � :D
?
what?
does this mean #5 is done?
or should we keep playing it a bit?
If I think there's a merge error do I /debug? Then what?
Is it a really bad one?
One that extends to the outer wall of the cube?
cube and layer #?  how do we see that?
where do we find out all these tools... I've been doing this for over a year and never knew!  :(
were they in newer tutorials or something?
(when echo is online)
this one rarely sits in laps... so when he does, all accomodations are made
Any ideas? http://tinypic.com/r/11w62vs/6
uch, the angle is a bit unlucky... Is this other thin branch coming from the cell as well?
right?
But is the overlap correct? That's the thing I'm confused about
Well... other opinions?
autapse?
ah, I think, that's what I meant. Is that one?
whats when I click te I�m finished and hear a 
sound and nothing happens?
Awww... who wants to help? :D
looks likely to me. I've seen more than usual this cell? 
But I thought, an autapse should be more... bouton like?
Aren't synapses like that?
What idiom is that? I am pretty sure, I didn't lose anything...
sarcasm? what is that? :D
i always say that when I 'almost' get 1000 points
where are you nkem?
@smalljude what country are you in?
I lived for years where there was no real seasons to speak of, and I missed it
80? ... oh you mean fahrenheit  :P
wow.... I'm lucky it never got that cold in the winter when I lived there
-20? I think
hehe    it's 16? here... gorgeous sun
when I got inseide I couldn't articulate properly
i pretty much prefer cold to hot...would rather be too cold than too warm (I don't cool down well, not sure why)
how hot is it there.. a lot I imagine
@sara what brought you to Niger?
well, it's the first day of spring, isn't it?
the guy bbqing in the snow?
how did you do that?
yeah...sebastian was really liking it the other night when he was in here
i bet you know what many of us are wondering Amy... :)
are we running out????
running out of sanity?
oh worried about running out of cubes?
I'm literally doing someone else's research when I should be working on my own
/me wonders how to do that beta thing here :P
finals already? you guys don't have same semester as we do
oh hey guess what the average was on our quantum mechanics midterm
what was the average... 60?
what was it quantum? below passing grades?
what a man
dehydratable, put him in water and he'll answer what you need
did you read any of his books?
uh oh...are you stuck at the lab?
my text got super tiny for the chat and the overview and I can barely read it.  Any ideas on how to adjust that?
oh...now I know what you meant amy... to see the scores?
I don't know what else to suggest judy, that happened to me once and that worked...sorry
Whew. (Shift scroll, ctrl +, it's almost the same, right?) ;)
One more question - how often are there cubes presented with very little or no corrections to make? 
they tend to happen a lot when we're reaching the end of a cell (as in it's almost finished)
Thanks - Are they often just at the edge of a cell and move from one side of the corner to the other?  Small little short pieces?
Hey, Amy, you still around?
ketta, can you look at other people's cubes? Or is it just the yellow people?
in the overview screen. I couldn't figure out how to do it.
Okay, felt like I was missing out on something. :) Would be cool to see where my pieces fit.
I can't submit. I'm finished plays a tone but no points or leaderboard. Is there a key combo?
Nope, should be just "I'm finished." Did your point total at the bottom left update?
does anyone need to refresh the page to proceed and get a new cube?
where you here yesterday?
ok, you are playing with game sound on?
echo will have some stuff to fix when he gets back :D
it also worked when I turned off the sound, soory if I missed some of the chat :)
could it be that trailblazing depends on how much you play?
that would explain why I get mostly new cubes
?
/me doesn't know what you're talking about :D
is this common?
ah, ty - so the work is not lost?
how're yall doing!
Huh?
oh, Matt updated the site?
what side?
What if I did something wrong?
Ceck point: "I don�t seem to be doing too well�if I screw up, am I hurting anything?"
huh?
kettas FAQ? I think you know that one
/me should mention the /me function maybe? :D
Hm, do you know why the bug reappeared?
@nkem the sound one?
Cool. nkem, are you a programmer? Come work in the lab! We're hiring you know :) 
what exactly is "frozen"?
cube not loading?
rinda, did it work?
how does one trailblaze a cube?
when you are the first one to play it
how do you get one to do?
is it random?
will it tell you when you are trailblazing?
only when you hit submit
high scorer yesterday :P I'll purple myself when I get back tonigh
i'll enjoy it when I'm DONE!
enjoy when you're done with a drink!
that sounds cool!  Astrocyte by any chance?
Private beta? What do I have to do? :D
Maybe Compliments?
that lasted about as long as my niece and nephew when they "stop talking" to someone..
What happened to Star Burst?  I finished training and was on cube 3?
like a phoenix eh furball? :)
we are wondering what private beta means
amy, nkem is desperately wondering how to get into the private beta
ok what kind of beta is it about? i was off a few days
How do you know without trying? :D
That's how it's done :D
realy? i thought i was doing a bad job
aesthetic in chaos huh? :)
?
Is there a way to redo the tutorials?
I'm missing something, but I don't know what it is... typically only get 30 points or so on each cube...
do you get also some big ones with a lot to fill in?
and on which cell do you play?
Is there a type of cell that would be good for a novice to get used to the whole process?
Every cell is telling me that I've finished every cube...?
Oh, you know those cubes where one single layer is slightly shifted?
what about them?
I got one where half the layers are shifted :D
hey guys what's up
cubes are breaking? we're implementing the new star challenge.. may be some weird happenings
no cubes...on any cell?
how u doing
good bad ok????
boring at school?
haha so your'e playing eyewire in class?
why its not like im have work to do
are both of you guys in high school? 
"its not like im have work to do" - except maybe English/typing?
We're working on some demographic surveys for a paper -- we don't know anything about you guys except country and what you tell us in chat
@jake you're able to play on a chromebook?  cool!
is there a survey to fill to help you with the paper?
when i see it does it mean i can participate?
how do you guys get so many points? i can never get more than a hundred
what happens if a branch ends up at the same side of the cube?
hello?
I have one question. I from Georgia, but there is USA flag nest to my username in rank. any way to fix it? :)
@a5hm0r still having troubles?  Have you tried refreshing?
@ash were you out of cubes before the cell was disabled?
do you see that for any of the other cells?
but I'll see what I can do
I had the same bugs when I ran out of cubes on J 5
did echo do anything to fix it?
or did it just resolve itself"?
it's thereo nly when you're out of cubes for the cell
you could play the other cells? :) 
@anitram how many cubes did you do?
@dfawcett64, are you by any chance from norcal? 
I'll work on them tomorrow when I'm not as sleepy as now :D
I have a question. someone else on the atarbust around?
oh great, you can even see where I am
and if I do that?
which is why I was wondering
uh, is amy or hsseung there? cuz, i keep trying to start tracing,b ut nothing shows up, no matter what cell i do.
noooo! is amy there?
does anyone know if there is a way to choose the orientation of the cube?
?
What is this "Starburst Private Beta"?
Is there an other alpha working on the beta cell?
Ah. I see. Interesting. It sounds difficult. Is it by invite?
They ran a "Starburst challenge" about a week ago where you had to pass some more presolved tutorial cubes
gah, I just can't figure how it's gonna go all the way through the cube
and see what makes sense?
well, as it is, I can see exactly where it should go on 3d
can you give me a cube id?
did you just call me mom?
Is score affected by time spent?
how's the cube situation?
is dilentente even a word in englich?
almost half of the slices where shiftet  about 20 pixels in one direction
are you still in it?
what is 49749 so tricky about?
?
rprentki, where did you learn that number, please?
and then post in the 'Help What is This?!' section in the forum
And some day we will get those tricky cubes as new tutorials? :D
@engadin what sort of errors in the way the AI traced
or it going over the line slightly?
the notable ones, where it's clearly two (or more) things stuck together would be really helpful
@mr_bbs, yes?
Is there a desktop version of the client?
What browser do you use?
but have a look around and see what you think here
?
how do I change my nation?
Nation?
What
why can't a change my team?
.... Wait, nation?
you mean from the games?
what does NaN stand for? I just assumed it was weird abreviation of nation since it shows top eyewirers and nations below...
do you find the shift key useful when playing?
1000?!
when i said use shift
How did two people just get 1000?
Are you talking to nkem?
hm, not sure when I said that :) Maybe I misunderstood something
yeah, you really have to find a cube where a lot parts are missing
how do you start earning points 
what do yo have to do to earn points
have you finished the tutorial?
but i don't know how to get out of it...
It wont allow you to pick a cell?
can you try to return to overview?
?
like when i hit excape
when you do that it doesn't offer a button that says change cell?
I like how the interface is different on my computer than when I was doing it on my school's computer earlier
?
How have you been doing on them?
How good?
me?
tried a hard refresh?
so is the cube showing a 3d image actually useful really?
Does getting 20 points mean that I did something wrong?
hello starburst challengers, how goes it?
@ivolakit, excellent!  hs or college teacher?
what's the best way to go about it with a cell body?
well from when it was launched
i got more points from a 16 percent then a 95 percent how does that work?
ok. like I said, almost the entire cube is dark blue! I'll see what I can make of it and move on
ivol, did you add too much stuff or not enough?
That's why you got 16@spiral, still here?
ivo, could you try to take a screenshot?
how...
Is it really that bad?
so when you see stuff like that don't spend more than 5 tops
is what bad?
so if you get where I am
how come a accidently clicked check my work before i clicked any thing and got 100i can't see what slice you're on, can you select something near where you're talking about
actually, you just got an extra piece stuck on, see that?
where sara?
it's good getting a 0 percent right?
Why do you use the @ symobol?
it sounds like you're having trouble figureing out what to do?
how do I center the 3d again?
is that giant part right?
take a look at the  3D, see how the pieces fit together?
look good?
rprentki how is your name yellow?
team twitter?
how did you get admin\nco creator?
scripte?
do you know every puzzle by heart?
Nice :D What languages do you work with?
when you're out you won't have the check my work button anymore
Maybe you should autolink the video if they do badly? 
I help keep eyewire running smoothly, fix errors and what not
and it should be under the ? on the Get Hint button
When did you join EyeWire?
who?
I learned about eyewire when I F...... love science posted about it and the site couldn't handle that.
Same here haha. Didn't this place crash?
it's kind of fun some of the weird looks I've gotten when I've been doing this in studyhall.
Out of cubes?
since i'm a moron and did restore my iPod at 2am, what is faster: cable or wlan syncing? 
What generation?
do you get anything if your first place in the world in points?
the knowledge of advancing science?
Uh mr president sir you have a call from a 13 year old he won something called eyewire?
any idea what that is?
architect what's your top scroe?
"Mainboard" :P Oh well. What's the record anyone's gotten for a single cube?
what are SAC cells?
how do you know this
why is this not like minecraft i want ot click on that link :(
you are using firefox, eh?
do you even know how to java script
do you know how to java script?
how so?
college?
im 13 and i know how to java script *remembers wasting summer on it*
what ever it is
why
just why
C++?
what does that mean
why can't i do the sac thing
why can't i :(
fur ball your 10th place?
millenniumb let me guess your like 20?
why ketta :(
what
sac people...how's it been working today?
which cube should i do?
i can see where all the fibres go
While in the cube?
it showed where everything goes for like 1 minute
red view?
What were you testing for?
how was the test?
Why must the one section that takes forever to load be the most important? 
What is "OK"?
Are the majority of the users here in college?
what are you going for acida?
Interesting fact: I used to go by Millenium on some sites, when notably younger, before I realized it was underlined by spellcheck :3 
genetics is where it is at these days
I was happy when I realized computer science was NO bio/chem, just math and physics :)
how'd you like it 101454?
psychology is very interesting..especially when you get into the abnormal parts
CATS?
what happened to fetal pigs?
yeah @ketta it was...interesting...?
learning how the Red October worked = cool. Cutting up dead things = not so much.
a little birdy told me someone was running out of cubes, tht true?
How does the point system work?  Is it being compared to something?
 /me earn�d ? points
when does the server day ends?
EST... so... 2 hours to go?
Thanks.  Does anyone have an issue where the 3D image doesn't update as you fill in?  
@mapy not sure then...what browser are you using?
well, if you're using chrome (firefox can have a few problems), no idea why
what's up with trailblazing?
completely 3d missing?
or just some AI parts?
mapy, what's up?
ok, has 3D ever worked for you?
ok so you get the cube but not the blue neuron in the cube?
Are there cells that give more points on average, besides that private one?
ok, so this is recent?
It just doesn't update the 3D when I fill in the 2D
What browser are you using?
Standard, Canary, or some other type?
mapy, can you hit F12?
that'll open a window with the Java console (you might have to hit the console button) can you see if there are any red errors in there?
millenniumb, are you having same issue?
ahaha, just checking java console for fun?
Isn't there a huge security risk with Java?
we mean JS, when saying Java here
yes, security risk with Java?
Why not type JS?
mapy already back?
excel macros?
mapy, where aaaare you?
should we do search and rescue?^^
Wasn't Java dead before that anyway?
depends on what you want to do :D
what happened to mappy?
mapy, still having issues with the 3D?
Is it just me or are there a bunch of new cells?
Hmm... Is it sad that I forgot the existence of the Vietnamese flag? I was looking at the scores and was stumped when I saw it XD
?
:) it's what my dad called 'tactical eating'
ha, Greasemonkey, maybe? :D
can you try a hard refresh?  hit F5
oh, echo is back tomorrow?
oh dear, what did echo say?
The 3d is showing *nothing*?
would the sound affect this too - turning it off?
Or only the seed piece?
and you have the latest ff/chrome?
what does opaque paint do?
just wondering if your paint opacity was all the way to the left would it be transparent?
What video card do you use?
So wait, how can I access the SAC?
I know that it's in beta, but is that based on score, or referrals, or what?
Did you do the challenge before?
when it was live earlier, some of us passed the trials for SAC
amy?
and figure out how to make it better
and in 2d view you can see the stuff you added?
So, what is the ultimate goal of this again?
you said you talked to echo, what did he say?
Will a video be posted for us to see how they run?
i will poke him tomorrow when he returns, can you send an email to support@eyewire.org  it's easier to get the programmers to check somethin
hm, how many different SACs are there right now?
Or lets say: How many seed pieces did you start with?
heads will roll?
any SAC challenge people online?
and cubes for all still?
I'm trying to figure out how not to need sleep.
but as we do them it generates more right?
how do you check?
I mean, can you check your individual progress?
what shows in overview as available is what you have available to you to do
Is it just me, or did the cursor get bigger?
Seems a little easier to see where you're centering it, too. That's nice.
was there alcohol involved?
I had one like that yesterday! In the middle, and one click gave a massive trunk?
I was gonna report it as an error, but figured I'd see what it did, first. First click shot a huge branch all the way down the cube.
I bet it was the same one, furball. On OSAC#1?
those were the days when there were only 3 of us online at a time
now it's popular, and you old timers can  talk about how much eyewire has changed
how easy it is now :p
when the load time wise rediculous, there was no tutorial, etc
remember when it was the video not the tutorial
well, where i went to high school, i was one of 3 'white' kids in my graduating class (rest were Natives mostly)
how'd you like it?
the washateria being where you do your laundry and put quarters in the shower machiene
I went back to visit once as an adult, and all the open fields where I played are crammed with city now, can't see Mt. Fuji for the smog. :(
my husband tells me i should go just to see what it's like to be in a crowd of people where very few are taller than me
he's 5'10" and felt like a giant when he was there while in the navy
and definitely no eye (?) contact
I wonder what I did they didn't. Or didn't do that they did.
Can I pout that I've been playing all day, and still can't get high score? :(
That's why I took my laptop. Can't install anything on hospital machines. And they still have like the 1969 version of Internet Explorer.
exams over?
Hi! Is that code?
So your students have been studying for an exam that doesn't even EXIST?
Why does that make me think of Schroedinger's cat?
do you think a beer will give me inspiration?
lol...I'm waiting for tomorrow when the other 2 exams are done
what class are you teaching btw?
how pavlovian
@geek2nurse are you new?
great, how long have you been with us?
Ummm, I forgot where it tells me that. Since you were on NPR.
@ketta what classes are you taking?
is @kshearer1000 new too?
What's your major, ketta?
what blows my mind is knowing how intelligent some birds are and comparing that to their brain size...
haven't figured out quite how it all fits in there :P
hsseung, got time to coach me a little? I think I've got a merger here, and never know how much to leave in/cut out.
You still there, @hsseung?
what's the question?
that looks pretty good but didn't you miss a small branch?
further down from the merger?
I took some out...I wasn't sure how much to leave in.
the merger was here?
Is it a merger? I'm not even sure I'm calling it the right thing. 
crappy spot in image? :)
Yeah, where I can only add too much or take away too much. :)
So which do I do?
Like it is now?
no one ever is...that's why we help each other
I should totally get CMEs for this. Any chance you can arrange that? ;)
CME?
don't know how to arrange it though
Yeah, that's what kids do to us. :) How old is he?
Hm, how is it possible to trailblaze if the cube is already visible in the overview?...
woah, what happened to the SAC cell last night
I have yet to see that I've trailblazed. Does my accuracy suck, or am I just unlucky?
how accurate
anyone else finds those cubes where there are spherical things tedious?
why ? 
is it just me being horrible at trailblazing or are the points for it much less than what you get usually
you guys always online?
When I don't have classes
online... most of the time. always tracing? no :D
what's up?
Is echo coming back today?
do the SAC challengers still have cubes?
want to see a magic trick again? :D (I hope it works)
um... hasta luego? Speak German :-P
server hiccup?
An bhfuil Gaeilge agat?
Gaelic ?
no, I just know how to use google translator ;)
what happened?
how are you
I'm fine , you ? :)
what are you doing
and where are you right now? I am in the US
where at
?
what level are u on
level ?
what do you mean?
what is that? lol
do u have to go?
so how old are u
so where do u go to school
I know about Belgian colleges ? it's called PHL
"Oh snap" is not nearly strong enough language for when I lose 45 minutes of tedious mapping to a bug. :(
Hmm. I've been using it all along...I'll keep plugging and see what happens.
so how is everyone
Why don't you take a nap? :D
me ?
why thx how is everyone
american kids choice?
then tell me what u think
??
wait what lol
haha, it's a bit different from what I listen to right now :D
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ66NCUICls&list=PLZj2suL7-kuLxK4NPU8fVlrbz9Pks4ikC
Where have you been (Rihanna) Pretty good & actually liking the video ^^
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L95MNCQzD-A
(That's why I said, Cimorelli is kinda different from what I am listening to) :-P
nkem is that film music ?^^
The beginning is from Anton�n Dvo?�k, I think
nope what nkem posted
@aniamal: do you know cimorelli or are just interested what we think about them?
what do u mean in person
how do you even get 28000 points^^
so 80k+ is the goal ?
wait, why am I aqua blue?
Oh, we get to do the SAC now?
Hm?
Why "again"?
Here's what I see: http://i.imgur.com/CYDsfBA.jpg
umm... can you click "Return to overview" and check the surrounding? Maybe that helps
..... Wait, >1000? Isn't that impossible?
How is OSAC different from the SAC challenge?
What does OSAC stand for? XD
and they are completely different from SAC?
I mean: no problems with them like SAC?
how goes the SAC nkem, still cubes?
um what
I've still got plenty, a5hm0r. Want some of mine? ;)
How do we know how many we have left?
..... :o There are thousands. You did all of those?
ok, so a5h is out of cubes?
anybody else doing starburst right now?
ok well if you check back in ah hour I can see what I can do
I don't know how you people do so many. I don't have THAT much of a life, but I can't even come close to matching you!
when did you run our	 a5h
There's a small line that I'm not sure is connected. Thoughts? Or am I not allowed to ask? http://i.imgur.com/P2NLUF1.png
yes, that is true. It's mentioned when you click on the ? on the lower right of the game screen
I noticed that. It was the first thing I checked when you mentioned it.
Its description in the ?, I mean.
why =_=?
Joe Hanson posted that on facebook... maybe he's here? :D
Remember how I said 60he-llo?
a SPHERE!?
what happened the day i was away?
sphere? which cell?
WHERE ARE THE SPHERES!?
But seriously, how do you run out of cubes?
hey, millennium, want to see something funny? :D
... Sure?
Did you expect 2000 points or something because of the SAC?
how much was that?
Points?
1,000. By the way, hot would I trailblaze?
Ah. So it should look empty in the overview? By the way, if you skip, do you lose it forever?
Wait... 35,572?!? How is that even possible. That shouldn't be possible, right?
Hm. Are amacrines receptors for ganglions?
maybe it's in the eyewire wiki?
How is everyone today?
A bit stressed, but doing well thanks! You? :)
woah?
How was your day? :D
huh? life? it's semester break :D
i'm 150k away from 1 mil...what does that say about me? =/
good job btw, i did a double-take when I saw your name up there :D
But I have *no* idea how ash got more than twice as much...
Wasn't echo supposed to come back today?
that's what I heard
?
really? it's awfully early for you to be leaving us..
And now I have enough time to watch more Maru videos ;) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxO9PG6l_Dw
is this the crazy japanese cat?
oh, so it's a famous one?
big fat grey cat?
aren't all cat have attachement issues with boxes?
Not sure... Maybe it's a special neuron type. BDAC... Box detecting amacrine cell?
anyone finally had the answer as to why it always starts on the 2nd or 3rd layer?
ketta are you done your finals?
good! how long is your break?
any plans?
(or is this how you call those weird cravings while pregnant?)
your cube?
yep...that's how I've been justifying the wacky stuff. Had one yesterday w/ 6 or 7 noodly branches, but it all looked 'natural', so I went
i try to skip only when i'm desperate; can't figure out what's right/wrong
that's why I left early
Hi. Anything exciting going on?
?
oh the submit button thing?
I'm getting some slowness with the site atm, anyone else?
wha?
i am not sure why, the number of users isn't abnormal
afk a few...hopefully it'll be better when i get back :P
Are you doing practice cubes? On the real ones, the system doesn't know.
That's why it needs us. :)
I've been getting a number of cubes that look pretty dang good...nothing with nothing to improve...is that normal?
why rprentki? are those easier for the AI?
yeah it's odd, I'll poke the programmer though and see if he knows what's up
anyone know how to zoom in on the cube using your laptop mousepad thing?
Btw, did you ran into some new (or old) problems so far? concerning SAC?
and you are not on a huge cell body?
hmm, weren't people just complaining about load time?
Hey, I read there was a Wiki page with tips on telling synapses apart from continuations, but I can't find it. Is it gone?
wiki.eyewire.org ?
oh, maybe the Help What is This section on the forums?
Yeah, it was in the forums, but when I clicked the link I got a 404 error, and search didn't find it for me either.
http://forum.eyewire.org/discussion/227/help-what-is-this#Item_68
Graaaah, how am I supposed to catch ketta with those small, perfectly AI-colored cubes?! :D
It wasn't about the autosynapses. I think it was to help with deciding when something is a synapse vs. an extension of the same dendrite. 
That's what I was hoping it was about, because that's what I need. But I couldn't find it. I'll see if I can find the message again.
and when something ends on a SAC it's usually a boutton, i.e. the big blobby thing
but it has to stop somewhere, doesn't it?
ok the two smooth sections, are the ends rounded?
and jsut sort of nudging each other, next time you come across one let me know if I'm online, or send me a screenshot?
I'll try and get a screen shot to help you when i get back to the lab tomorrow
if i skip a cube, will it come back?
come back to you?
testet that before. The "available cubes" count decreases when skipping
ok, then when you loose your connexion?
I wondered that too. I've lost a couple of really juicy cubes I had spent a lot of time on, when the plugin bugged out or something.
hey guys, quick cube count for me on the SAC?
I'm still fuzzy on how that part of things works. :)
our goal is to be faster than you guys, when everyone was running out of stuff over the weekend
not same number, but the day when I am out of cubes as not dawned yet
he makes you stop?
You know you're doing a lot of neuron mapping when....
Hey if we see something that looks "off" with the AI, like a connection that makes  no sense, should we ignore it or flag it somehow?
when your husband makes you stop :P
I've seen it a few times and wasn't sure what to do
off how?
actually you know what, i can see into your cube, give me a second
i'll just note it next time and mention it in the forum maybe?
ok so sometimes the AI colors outside the lines, when that happens you want to make sure you don't follow the mistake
rprentki, is it true it's more important if the merger touche the sde of the cube?
and when that is too hard I go to my super secret desktop version
like this can't be this kind of more colours?
let me check where on the list it is
I also want my cursor to quit turning into a text pointer when I'm trying to color a precise spot. That's probably just browser stupidity.
But it always happens when I need the crosshairs the most.
you loosse it?
what the text cursor, I have the same
How it looks when you're in a text editor.
Like when you hover over the chat window. :)
when exactly does that happen?
just random?
Mine used to do that when I used safari for this, then the problem went away with chrome!
Yeah. It SEEMS like it always happens when I have a precise tiny spot I'm trying to hit. ;)
no, systematically when I try to select without cliking, but by dragging
Yeah, seems like I see it more when dragging, come to think of it. 
But also when just clicking.
hm... it *does* change the cursor when you drag
Now that you mentioned it, mine actually does that too. Changes the cursor when dragging. I guess it's only for some cubes because I didn't 
But you still have crosshairs, right?
but it should become a text editor?
true nkem, that's why i want colors :P
Usually I get the crosshairs without the circle when I click. But sometimes I get a text cursor instead.
for you :D I only said how it *should* work :D
mac?
i know, that's why it's there
argh why you load so slow, silly cube
quick poll, what music should i blast back?
ooOOh, You know Wiked?
Okay, I *have* to ask...any of you MIT people know a recent grad named Laila Wahedi?
friend of yours?
cool, grad, undergrad?
Dang, I don't know how to tell. She was there 4 years and got two BSs and an MS. So, yeah, sort of. :)
how do I shut this faggot bing up
really? drives me batty
I wonder what happens if I mute someone before they can type /silence
will it forever bing at them?
Bing?
Bing?
want me to check real quick?
what?
this one continues, but I can't tell where
so you can skip or submit as it--I'll have to fix it tomorrow when I get to the lab, because everyone got stuck on it (including me)
You know the cube ID?
I feel like it shouldn't be a smiley face when we discuss the GrimRepaer, something more menacing
like a piercing glare?
or that knowing "someday, you'll be mine" face?
?
Hm, sadly many of Pratchetts jokes are lost when translated to german
Yeah, I don't know how you'd translate some of that stuff.
only the professors get me, and they don't really care when there are 200 people in a class ><
yeah sara...i don't look my age, but when they figure it out, I'm like this weird thing they have to investigate
is what most say first off
how do i go back to tutorial 1?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6ENAPXN9Lc&list=PL-IggV222ozRiKUehYTkFaW1T5rQ1iChs
the Frenchies are what get me (and Australia)
that's why they're always saying WTF mate?
nkem, what country are you in?
i had 2 German exchange students stay w/ my family when I was in high school, but I've never been
Hm, Americans in Germany... Ok, so I guess AF means Airforce and he was in Rammstein? :D
rammstein? rofl!
Argh, see?!
I sometimes find myself wanting to use them when writing notes in patient charts. ;)
when i worked for a veterinary clinic a few years ago I had to stop myself from doign the same thing!
What about when writing papers in school? ;)
all serious and dry, no i, we, us, etc...and when you get in that mode, all smileys are forgotten
I just never could figure out how to do smileys in proper APA format. :)
I am mystified at being able to turn these cubes on their axes. I have no idea how they could have sliced the same cube three ways.
ask sebastian next time he pops in, he'll tell you how they do it probably
What are the chances I'll understand it? ;)
well, I don't guarantee it...but i asked about the slicing process (in terms of how they prepare the retina) and he explained so I could 
Did the cubes all get complicated, or did everyone go to bed? ;)
Or even if after you do a cube, you could see how other people had solved it. But maybe that would skew things. I dunno.
and definitely, until they get more/better servers, that probably would bog it down...seeing what others do
Is anyone else finding that 3d scrolling with shift held down slows to a crawl?
This is the time of day when I can start crawling up into the top ten. :)
same..especially on days when I had classes until late afternoon
Where are you, kshearer?
yeah? where?
Where did you grow up?
oh?
Today my mom was trying to figure out how my dad got on the ACLU mailing list...
Brilliant, no? ;)
I don't see my family very often, but when I do we have a rule...no religion, no politics
trying to think what would really get my mom scratching her head...
ketta: for april fools?
Just let it go. Your brain will keep working on it, and in a few hours, or days, the answer will pop out when you least expect it. ;)
When I was in the tech industry, doing software development, that's how I would solve the tough problems.
sneak attacks?
I guess when I'm asleep is when I interfere the least. ;)
that's how I solve a lot of problems in classes...I've literally woken up figuring out an organic chem issue
except when they're not :P (which is rarely, but usually when you just want to sleep)
ugh! I just want to know how to get higher points!!!
@lizbeth yep, w/ practice you'll get better...are you working on J-6?
@lizbeth have you checked out the videos on the blog?
kinda fun, eh?
what part of psych do you like best?
I love happy psychotic people...they're always interesting. And I love when I can make something better.
pharmacology...as in the effect of drugs etc.?
Yeah...which neurotransmitters are involved in a particular symptomology, and how to tailor a pharmacological treatment to best address it.
i loved learning about abnormal psych and how more was learned from finding abnormalities than anything else :)
...and that's why science majors need so much of it!
There's this magic thing that happens when you reach out and touch the part of the person beneath the craziness...
did you ever see Twelve Monkeys? 
have you seen 'he was a quiet man'? I think that's what it's called
but I liked it, I can relate to it and can see how some people lose their minds
Yeah? (Like I'm going to remember the answer!)
and it struck me what the right answer was d'oh
?
ok so how do you get into the starburst cell? I completed all the training and was working on it at one point, and now it says private beta 
did they kick me out because I suck ? lol
If you were working on it, you should have access. Did you get an email about it?
no?
when I click on start playing
you get a popup?
you did them a few days ago, the super hard ones?
where on the blog is the info?
any ideas where that is?
no lizbith! you're just learning, and that's OK (that's why lots of people do the same cube)
anyone online?
how are you?
how are you?
business travel?
any positive results from eyewire?
What are these cubes that are filled with what seems to be the same contiguous material?
how do we play
why that?
your successor?
can i disable these sounds ? i keep disabling it but its really annoying
t work remote?
which chats?
maybe you still come back here to trace cells? :D
Ah, "of course I will come back to chat"? :D
Hi echo, are you back to work?
disappeared?
do you see anything on the left side? like an empty cube? or nothing at all
are these dendrites we are chasing?
echo I wrote about a bug to support@eyewire.org for about a day ago; is it received?
Hm, I think I had this once when I clicked really fast on "Start Playing" and "Return to overview" repeatedly...
which bug was it Ivova?
I know what he'll say :D
Unfair isn't it? I would say so. :)
hey, wtc. Did you know, that echo finished the challenge in 12 cubes as well? :D
I like it, would love to hear what you guys think
GrimReaper powers for nkem?
@echo, on the forums?
we have a problem on the starburst cells where people tend not to trace branches across the cube (stop prematurely)
so how about a mulitplier if your tracing hits another wall of the cube and you agree with the consensus
no?
Hm... from each orientation?
3 tabs on top of the 2d view?:D
or a question: have you thought of changing the view?
how do you mean gisela?
you are asked: Are you sure? there you could also have: Have you thoght of changing the orientation?
Combined with a question "Are you sure about that branch/missing branch"?
Hm, that might depend on the persons self-esteem(?). It would be bad if a new player removes a branch he found...
that's why the consensus has to be right 95it's important to explain that it's not what you missed and what you erroneously added, it's how you differed from the consensus
I would also like a "try again" button/option when getting a weak score - would learn more.
how can I change my flag?
I change orientation often in 3d, and sometimes do better when it changes in the 2d automatically with the start over button.
but when experienced you just know where to look for it without changing orientation
So to summarize, a tutorial which explains changing 2D orientation, and the perpendicular/cross-section technique at important points where.
2 minutes ago I thought a had it and got 40 pts. I would really like to know where I went wrong.
gisela, you can do this by pressing "return to overview", when you get your score
i don t understand how you did it whathecode
let me check what you just submitted
was it on the starburst?
was there anyone else that ran out of SAC cubes, or was it just me this tiem?
Fun? That's tough work - like Eyewire :D
echo?
can anyone have a look at my cube?
Confuscious?
I have a cube on the left with no color in it???
?
did you try to refresh?
okay so the issue is no color in 3d?
echo: can you look at my cube? See the merger?
has this happened on multiple cubes?
echo, when you're done with real problem, I have a silly question
see the little peace missing?
I have an elephant nose (what is the name in english?)
hey echo..do you know if the cube people are doing anything with SAC?
So, why don't I get more points?
Am I supposed to follow all kinds of new projections?  Or stick to the one I see?
how come that there are sometimes cubes that are not connected to anything else?
you mean when it looks like it puts out in the middle of nowhere?
that's on the starburst?
@rprentki is the starburst page a collection of branches? or is it one cell?
yes I know in the past Jinseop has added new start-points where contacts were identified with another cell (that you can't see on the 
Hm, or maybe it was a user-made merger that created new cubes?
And other users cut the merger again?
how's it going!
and you?
jetlagged?
where's amy
how did it go?
where's "there"?
�a va? so Paris?
may i ask why starbust is private?
?
2 square? so the 2d view?
hmm @sara this consistently happens?
are you in france?
ok, and rotating the 3d view does nothing? (yes, doing 3d stuff updates 2d)
sorry I left, hoping it would be ok when I came back, but no, not yet
oh man! that sucks. Hm I'm not sure what to tell ya sara
another quarter won't load?
but don't ask me why...
how's it going Amy?
how are you
where are you..France now?
?
what's been happening from y'all's end?
frustrated how so
what's going on though
whoa..that's all?
do you guys have cubes atm?
ash you got like 38K points yesterday though, how is that possible if you're out of cubes
tracing other cells?
And you are sure this is a bug and not a feature? I mean - is there something different between SAC and other cells? (concerning algorithms)
we learned that we can barely function when he is goine haha
am I still aqua blue?
So, it's really the "disagreement" between all users that confuses the AI?
@nkem but...what :)
@crazyman waiting until tomorrow? why?
planning to play all day and see how high score I can get
Oh yea what's the all time top now, 40ksomething
so ketta you only have 1 cube total to play?
what is SAC?
can anyone play there? list says private beta so I have not tried...
just a quick survey, how many cubes does everyone have?  star: and j: 
@ash ok that's pretty good, what's the ratio of star to j?
and ignore the new merged part?
is there a picture of a merger somewhere?
in that case...which one would you keep?
I would click "Return to overview" and look how the cell looks
you're on firefox, eh?
rinda, everything working?
There is also a nice thread in the forum: http://forum.eyewire.org/discussion/227/help-what-is-this/p1
nkem,  would you please post that link again?
did you get the other link as well?
http://forum.eyewire.org/discussion/227/help-what-is-this/p1
I haven't gotten it yet, but heard a bit of it...I liked what I heard :)
really? that's an odd stats
what made you give up on the job?
prasanna are you getting pissed of at your cube?
or is there a cat involved?
a cat?
or a three years old?
how do we play this game
Are you doing this for a school assignment?
? what kind of course?
architect, what cells are you playing that allow you to earn so many points? I keep getting ones that have been well screened
how can you get in on the private beta?
why? you worked ore then that?
does a neuron ever connect to itself? i'm on one of the horizontal cells. seems like a branch splits into two smaller ones whose ends touch
@sarabc, 'ore'?
It's funny how it all relates to the people you are playing with. Maybe the biggest influencing factor is it's private beta now, so the ...
..agreement is higher?
and if everyone has the same path, then you get more points?
If the starburst is private, then perhaps it would be more fair for you to have your scores for that separate from the rest...?
and the synapse look like they.re holding onto the other neurone? like a little had shape
@echo ... then the question becomes, should we start adding pieces which we feel are incorrect?
What is the difference between a false positive and a false negative from a user perspective? :)
the question may become "if this were to continue, what's your best guess at how it would do so?"
@ketta have you had any since this morning?
Is is helpful to the mapping to fill in all the tiny vacant spots, or only if it leads to a new branch?
@echo ... instead of expecting more people to 'trace across the cube', ... couldn't you adjust the required agreement ratio?
E.g. if 2 people trace it, it's added?
How is it possible that some people have several hundred thousand points?? I play every evening and don't even have 10k. Sheesh
@echo, but isn't that what you want, more noise (that needs to be cleared up by Grim)?
that means how much hours/day?
for me? depends on the day...just started spring break, so I play off and on all day between chores etc
when classes start again though, not so much
don'T your eyes get tired? 
did I break it echo? >.<
@echo yeah..I don't think anyone is getting any more cubes that what they started with today
@echo, did you read my feedback about the tutorial earlier?
probably not wtc did you write it in chat?
btw. echo, would it help to assign players preferentially to "dead ends"?
So that new cubes are generated?
did you ever answer whether false positives or false negatives are better? i'm guessing false positives?
cause they're easier for you guys to distinguish when seeing the big pic?
that's what I heard :)
ok, got it. so when in doubt, mark it
so, is that why it's slow...because of that issue, or is it something else entirely? (the spawner)
I know how it feels to go away and come back to a job with a lot to do to fix things
Ha, SAC is now 255 cubes in size - are you sure, you didn't limit cell size to 1 byte? :-P
jinxing? great word, thx :)
you know what it means in english?
easter POTATOES?
'murricans are as silly as anyone else when they have been at the keyboard too long.
If we're talking about unfair, how about when working on cubes such as this? http://i.imgur.com/PHIbVVV.png
What is that particular structure of anyhow?
Although isn't that a characteristic of autism as well?
Not nearly 1000 though, did you ever find that one? :)
That's what I don't get ... why isn't SAC giving me cubes on the extremities (@echo?)
But that would improve 'growth' as well no?
You did perfect, and receive this personal applause from me. Gratifying no?
Now that I know what is supposed to be done, things will be better
Hm, I don't think rprentki wants to spend her friday evening with this cube, eh? :D
seems so, do you need this?
how come you had to wait for me and could not do it yourself?
huh? no... I think, that was just coincidence
I wonder why those cubes spawned now...
which?
why that, jamie? :D
haha - I just logged on and did a couple cubes when I saw your question - was just afraid - "oh, no I traced wrong"
that's what I keep thinking every time SAC stops spawning cubes >.<
when they were graded and returned, the prof said "so, there was this one question that I left the answers in by mistake...."
and he was right...I was tricked once by a prof way back when, and it's always stuck with me
now, if the professor was a woman, would you have thought differently?
echo, you changed something, didn't you?
no....?
btw why do you ask nkem :)
ah, so it finally catched up the last 20 minutes?
Is this "muscula" useful?
what is prefetching?
does it have to do with cubes?
How do you prefetch a cube?
@jardin what do you mean?
afk a bit, hopefully more cubes when I return :P
is this isosurface extraction stuff done in JS? I never tried "marching cubes" or something similar. No idea, how fast this is... :(
no risk no fun, eh? :D
what the heck?
but also the ones below and on top?
umm... and is it -maybe- loading the quarter(s) that contain(s) the colored part first, now? :D
So does anyone have neat plans for the weekend?
what cell is that?
what will that do echo?
maybe black cursor would work?  Or at least to have the option?
the circle disappears, when JS seems a bit on it's limits
it's supposed to when dragging
actually the circle is supposed to go away when you click
pet projects?
I still don't get it. Pet Projects? Is he stroking little kittens? :)
seriously or are you being silly?
oh, wait. Pet- also means "the most loved ....", right?
I didn't want to launch into an explanation if you were joking, that's why I asked :P
anyone else's 2 d not coming out of the checkerboard pattern?
mine is OK jaimie...have you tried a refresh recently?
hate it when that happens
you probably already did this...but did you try restarting?
email?
you  mean I should email support?
did your update affect the eyewire cache?
so it's just slow to load?
but if it would have worked! How glorious would that have been?
That's what I like about programming. It's just like a text adventure :D
like a choose-your-own-adventure book?
or is it an old version? :-P
ah, you know what happened last time :-P
nkem it was affecting you right?
I would like to know the difference between when I'm getting points for spending more time and when I'm getting it correct. 
how you compare to the work others have done and how much volume is filled in is more important
I've had several small pieces that seem fine to me so I haven't added anything to them and I've gotten 20 points for them.  Is that ok?
@lizbith true when you're adding a lot
Is 7 available yet?
jaimie..did you you lose a bunch of sac cubes?
not sure why hooves
doesn't seem like you lost any?
do you think nkem stole yours?
Jamie, you're in the Starburst Beta?
How notorious are there cubes I've heard oh so much about?
Anything new and exciting today?
breaking the record today crazy?
we'll see what happens
well, we don't really know how long after someone else does the same cube that retro points show up
does this look like a merger?
of the connection?
http://puu.sh/2ml4v - this is how it looks like in the 3D view
yeah, in WoW I've got addons that can search my bags.. I need that for my apartment sometimes. "Do I own one of these?  Where is it?"
Ouch. How do you mean?
how's it going! dominating the leaderboard I see ! :)
he prob won't be online for several hours - want me to send in an email bug report?
weren't there some other cell bodies that are blocked?
I've been trying to figure out how to make the cell bodies appear -- i think it would improve the interface
will there be other cells to do after the J cells?
Maybe they pushed a new version?
Nobody in my house wants to be around me when the internet goes boom
my 'backup' is my phone, and there's no free wifi where I live, so..not really a backup :P
I had 10 available SAC cubes when I started an hour ago
a bug?
found out how to get the 2D view turn red
when that happens I always suppose that I wnet way off course
will have to tell echo about it when he comes online
whats up?
what is the problem?
The cubes are overlapping each other by.. don't know 40 Pixel?
hm, you could note the time when it happened
And could it be, that it was the same cube, but a different path?
got big plans?
don't you hate it when they don't consult you first before planning classes? I mean...really! :)
hmm?
is possible to enlarge the brush size?
you got 44k?
wow 45k in one day?
why stop at 45k?
for the parents or the children? :P
could anyone look at my cube?
one AM you mean?
what did I miss? :D
In those few seconds? Everything.
how your parents sold you to eyewire for pennies
ah the good old days of knowing if what you clicked was right
and the winner takes it all?
is this a legit cell body in SAC?
What would be wrong with it otherwise?
Not a SAC cell body?
what if you're wrong? :D
We can't do ALL the work can we?
so is it better to get it wrong and let them reap it than not do anything if unsure?
(is what echo told earlier at least)
oh, but not for the other cells?
They just end up in some small 'young'? branches.
yes, I see many that I can't see where they would go across the whole cube
does it actually matter filling in every piece of a branch?
what is SAC btw?
and you are saying could have cross branches?  like I think if I have a branch going east west and another going north south it is wrong
Yeah .. what other cells will they trace after the J?
K?
L?
and after that, no idea (for this dataset..can't remember all of what Amy said)
really nkem? thought there were 2 more after 6...I could be wrong
btw are these results being used to teach an AI, or just as-is?
but then what will we do?
very different from what we've been doing
They already talked about it?
how big are each of these cubes again? 16x16x16 microns? 
crap. I'm in a cube where the computer thought two passing dendrites were one. ):(
@theman2000, can you avoid it?
When the AI 'fills up' the wrong dendrite, does the newly added piece reach edges of the cube?
If so, don't add it, is it possible to continue the original dendrite?
didn't you say earlier you were close to 500k?
Bonsoir, ca va ? :P
et toi?
there is one? great :)
dude - @crazyman you're incredible!! how many hours have you been playing?? 
eyewiring while at the airport... dedication vs. addiction?
nice! I just had to pop in to see what's happening -- gotta run to dinner also, see yall soon? @crazyman stay online for a couple hours!
midnight EST? can do
that's when the points reset
that's 5 am CET?
Can you do it? 
I don't see why not
crazy are you doing SAC?
wait, you did this without SAC?
we'll still be here when you're done :P
y a t'il quel qu'un ici quel parle francais? 
i just nod or wave when that starts...not bilingual in any sense :(
haha next time you're asked what languages you speak, definitely list neuron
because of weather?
they're not being too clear about why it's delayed
in australia?
so there are bunch of aussies in australia? :)
it would be crazy if there were bunch of dinosaurs when i look out of the windows
the SAC? 
yeah the main issue is when we don't have enough star-certified people online tasks don't spawn
hmm - even off the big cell body? 
feel so bad when an influx of new folks comes in and some are driven away by slow loading etc.
did you see what the AI did this morning?
no what?
were you the one that emailed about it? 
and it's not 38480, ketta?
they're discussing how we could start to crowdsource the AI to improve the feature set
that's why you hold the scroll bar with the mouse
I use a touchpad, let me see if I can figure out how to do that. Was trying to copy/paste but I wasn't quick enough.
I think adjusting the chat is on echo's list...he knows we don't like how it jumps :P
anything like?
Oh, man, I love it when a new cube pops up with two teensy specks of unconnected blue. Seems to always turn out amazing. :)
and then there are those times when it looks like that's going to happen but the site is slow to load...
was that the cube I got 500 on?
can you see my cubes?
hey crazyman is there any time today that you haven't spent playing this game?
cell photos. I've tried everything I can think of. Any ideas?
does anyone else see the face? :D
depends how you look at it
not sure how, there were like 200 and now there aren't any
how close are you?
how long have you been playing?
If you have a complaint you should figure out how to make it better then have them hire you to fix it
why does one require an account to submit voluntary work ?
connected people?
want to look at a merger error?
51027 ketta?
what could go wrong :p
@stakhanov right click to erase isn't working?
can we get some more SAC cubes?
are you guys out of cubes?
@stak has it always been the case?
oi. why do i have to do the tutorial again?!
#lems it teaches you how to play and correctly fill in what/where
has it been a while since you've played? they've added some more
@ketta, see how this hits the edge of the cube, barely?
yea its been a while , do i have to redo the entire thing?
so submission as is is OK?
@lems how long has it been/are you at the very beginning?
hmm.  Are you at the very beginning?  Like it says welcome to EyeWire?
is it possible you have more than one account on here?  There's no reason it should have reset you
when my friend did the first tutorial he had to get 6 in a row at least 80you're special?
weird how?
you don't happen to have the cube# for the second one do you?
it's interesting, you may have noticed that the piece that led to the merger touched the edge of the cube just before the merger?
are there enforced standards of accuracy ?
and when people make mergers the GrimReaper comes out to cut off the wrong pieces
but what happens when you're not here to check ? :p
I don't check every piece obviously, but in the overview I can see when a cell starts looking wrong
so are some reasons for blindness resulting from malformed neurons?
@rprentki, can I get some advice? This one's messing with me.
what circle?  I can't see where the plane is
Better? I don't know how you see it. :)
ok I see what you're talking about, so i'm going to deselect something
what happens if 80you don't see me deselecting stuff?
?
Okay. But the circle part is okay?
@stak, if most players miss a branch, or add one incorrectly that's when we get mergers
well, I have extra weight, as do the other admins, which is why I can edit things
truly?  because I am so afraid of adding wrongly
I' sometimes see some branches in the cube with a very thick border, are those neurons or something else?
when not sure is it better to add wrong or to let it be?
also acida, if you're not sure, take a screen shot and post in the Help What Is This section on the forum
that way other people can weigh in with advice, and everyone can learn a bit about what to do
do you need a second opinion?
I submitted,  dont know how to get 2nd opinion - got over 400 pts so I think it is ok
you can see our cubes while we are working on them?
is there a way to mark something a different color ?
Is there any way to use a third color to keep track of unconnected paths that you've already explored?
Does getting 20 points or less always mean that you made mistakes?
which ones? the mirror puzzles?
yeah some of them are annoying, especially when you would like to work freely and have to achive some "goals"
is it going to be the big hairy mess in the middle?
is there i a small merger in j7? or does it just look odd
A merger you say?  The GrimReaper is pleased when mergers are brought for the sacrifice
the morphology of the cell, the position of the axons and dendrites help us to tell what type of cell it is
are you done reaping?  Had to answer door
in your cube?
yes I show you where
i believe you can trace around it?  give it a try
the easiest way is to select the piece with the merger, and then try to find the point where the piece goes around
it's not 51347 by coincidence? :D
what just happened?
did you find a solution, nkem?
the one w/ the littler merger error?
why don't we let the AI use our brains?
a pensive?
maybe pension to play all day?
A pensieve, as in Harry Potter? That'd be helpful :)
I stopped at volume 4 can you explain?
were can I order one ? :
what if you lose it?
that would be bad, woudln't it?
does it look like a merger?
are you all still low on SAC cubes?
how low?
alright, I will see what I can do
@crazy, don't you ever think you play too much?
what about eating or studying?
jamie must have all time high score, right?
if you guys ever figure out how to play while you sleep we're all in trouble
does dreaming count?
you challenging me? :D
was it for fun or was he a farmer?
north or south?
a farmer?  like on farmville?
how about some lottery numbers?^^
driver issue?
graphics display driver?
did you color a cube with almost everything already colored? :)
making anything good?
feel free to pester me via email when you guys run out of cubes again
does it mean anything ?
do you see the whole neuron in the overview?
well even with imperfect AI , you can tell how they should be
isn't there an easier way to keep it around ?
you so you can see where the neuron leaves the cube?
I have a starbust cube with a merge on a half a cube. How may I repost it's number?
Is our starburst supposed to have 2 cell bodies like that?
That's what confused me the first time:
jenwolfe8, I was kinda bored and posted a (hopefully) in-detail answer to the "How are points calculated" question
What was it? Ca, Na and K?
Darn, 1 year ago I had to explain how neurons fire :(
for what nkem?
you mean salt? :D
is that specific enough?: D
?
latin names?
ketta, did you see my result of pure boredomness? Do you like it? Is it something for the FAQ? :D
Pissimpible? :D
except when I'm being silly
I don't even know what you're trying to say w/ that one :P
oh, that was "How I met your mother"
http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Possimpible
how much is your total score?
tha'ts what I said, at the end of the day you'll beat that for sure
and I chat too much - that's why I never get a lot of points
how long have you been going crazy?  brilliant score :)
you trying for 24?
you can still see straight??!
maybe next time when I want to beat my own high score :D
I HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS!
how's it going!
I really like where ash stopped
how's ti going everyone!
how the hell did you get so many points today?
why no points for trailblazing?
plus more points later when others trace the same cube you did
any requests? 
can you make it darker?
ok?
when I hit 70
how about every time you top your own score the red gets darker
until it's pitch black?
Oh, good, @amy, while we're waiting, can I get your opinion of this cube?
What about right at the beginning where the AI did it -- is that a merger?
top player of the day?
more people to go on team echo?
interviewing for what?
ya crazy you're in school, right?
Do it, Crazy! :) My son went to work for Intel when he was 15. 
Awesome, isn't he? ;)
@hsseung, can you peek at my cube for a sec? It's making me crazy. And not in the good way like crazyman!
I *think* right where the dark blue comes into the cube there's a merger. Am I right?
where dark blue meets light blue
What about right where the dark blue comes into the cube?
So I'm not going to add anything there; think that's okay?
4?
I was still so new when I did the star challenge that I keep thinking maybe it was jus a fluke that I made it. ;)
i don't know what it is...some ppl are better than others
nature or nurture? :)
there are a fair number of us 'seasoned' people that play, aren't there?
newcomers think "it's just coloring...how could it be hard?"
knowing what the cells are supposed to look like helps
and as we learn, that seems to be important (i can spot mergers now where a few weeks ago I couldn't very easily)
that's exactly what it is...knowing what neurons look like
the images have ambiguities...the only way to figure out the right answer is to know what neurons look like
What does the term merger mean in this contect?
a merger is when the AI makes a mistake
we also use "merger" when EyeWirers make a mistake
what mistake, example?
basically when you fill in an obvious connection and it "merges" a completely unrelated neuron
neurons , or dendrites? So what does one when that happens?
depends on how bad it is
@hsseung, I found where you go for getting CME accreditation. http://www.accme.org Sent it the other night, but I think you had gone.
CME for doing this? Cool! LOL
Wouldn't it be? I need a bunch of them for licensure; would be a fun way to earn some.
that's how it was at the job I worked before i started going back to school...
ZOOLOGY, MD, what's the difference?
but I know when a patient says that to a human doctor...
What's your area of practice, maryjoyw?
I wonder they are! But humans associate 'doctor' as a doctor for HUMANS not animals, but I always think, HUMANS are animals, so what's the  
difference?
any admin want to examine my cube?  huge merger issue
can we guess and you say if we're right?
Hospitalist or outpatient?
any admins on??
Say what geek?
MD specializing in homeopathy?
corrections?
That's why I was asked if I was a vet ... Get the connection?
so i'm guessing if a extend a slight nueron and it fills have the screen, I should not extend it, right?
I get it...i was thinking what kind of field is THAT?
Not being able to do what I know my patient really needs. :(
If all else fails, post a screen shot in the forums and see what people think.
psych or medicine, mjw? Or are you not telling? ;)
You know how you tell psych staff from patients, right?
Can you tell the difference between the prison officers from the inmates?
inmates get to leave...sometimes? :P
(nurse Ratchet was a lifer, my dad said that when he'd tell geek's joke)
How do I tell someone about this terrible cube?
there's a thread called 'what is this?' or something like that
I got a cube where the seed doesn't touch the wall. Is that possible?
I guess so follow it and see where it takes you
how do you  get 70,000 in a day?
By not sleeping?
crazyman, are you playing more than one cube at a time?
Are you a computer?
what do you think?
Heh... rillabee got fooled points earned by trailblazing?
who messed up the SAC? :D
wow, demolishing color? :D
What stream?
awesome!! also, could you guys vote for eyewire in the catalyser while you're waiting? http://www.biovision.org/focus2-catalyzer.html
hi claire...is amy on yet?
Hey, hsseung - did you see the new cell in SAC? Thats not a SAC at all, right? :D
live 3? not live 2?
Just to be sure: Focus 2 (Live 2) is the one with Amy later, huh?
amazingly, neuroscientists still aren't sure what its function is
otherwise the retina would look boring? :)
not sure why that merger happened.  then again, EyeWirers just barely voted for it
Do you remember which cube it was?
what means "gotone"?
@lucas, the 2D is all in red?  If you refresh the page it'll fix that
it happens when you click and drag on the 2D view during transition
ooh, he'll like knowing how he can reproduce it
you guys are all have cubes?
only 9 eh?  did you run out at all after I was on last night?
ha, hsseung - she said "The brain doesn't like empty space". You see? Another evidence that AII-Cells are nothing but placeholders :-P
anyone seeing the typo in the stream? :D
humanit?...
Question is, could you have surpassed the top daily highscore without the double points? :)
Ever ran out of cubes?
Around the earth? :) Bet we haven't even passed 1mm.
how's it going! presentation is over, yay! haha
How did you do?
how did it go?
does anyone how to change you username?
that'd ya think? 
lol :) is there a way to watch it now?
yes, let us know when it's up
I will watch then. :) How long did you talk?
And did you mention how awesome we were?
Maybe she was talking about crazy people in general?
I did mention how awesome yall are!
@wtc what's your score these days?
And who is this @diizelaj?
Merger with what then?
2000 points cubes? WHOA dude
geeez..so this is what I get for sleeping in a little? missed 2k cubes and Amy's presentation??
Still here, @crazyman? You're not only crazy, you're NUTS! ;)
Who to?
But can't you filter out those that are more accurate already?
did they like it? :D
@wtc we can gauge accuracy, but in order to show feedback, we would shoe players what they missed vs what they found relative to other playe
i.e. to show the cubes where players make the most mistakes in order to helo improve
what are you and wtc talking about?
@amy, what about I 'flag' the cube after finishing it (seeing my score) as difficult, people most likely skipped stuff.
When you miss a branch you usually don't choose not to add it.
Scores might end up more "fair" if the first n (5?) to do a cube were all considered trailblazers; then their combined efforts could
@crazy we're talking about how to add feedback to help people improve
@geek?
That's I guess what accuracy reflects at the moment? Don't know how far they got with that.
that's why you get a bonus
BUT we don't provide a way for players to lean how accurate they are or to iprove
@amy Yeah .. finding the cell body pretty much means that 'starting point' synapse is finished no?
what's the accuracy minimum for trailblazing?
Just had a hugh branch in the SAC, so cell body in the make?
was there a bad merger?
that's where all the 2k point cubes came from
how accurate do you have to be to trailblaze?
how many points
should I be worried that SAC is giving me cubes from the grey region?
at lest...it seems that way when it zooms
what are the gray and black regions?
...and late last night when I was almost out of cubes, it kept recycling cubes I'd done
sure?
ketta, did you miss the huge merger this morning?
oh yeah reb, that's what I think for black too
But gray was 'to be discontinued' right?
I think green is supposed to show where new cubes have generated
green?
Speaking of which .. are they still pessimistic about the SAC cell performance?
I mean ... seems like we are finding those cells no?
I miss the old overview where you could click on your name, and all the cubes you did would show up. :)
when I ran out of J5 cubes the next day the new branch was all green
and it disappears quickly when you do see it
oooh ... maybe that's why it shows then.
I defininitely saw it more often when fewer people were playing
none of the data is real, they're trying to see how gullible we are
I know they have a big screen in the lab where they watch all this....HEY GUYS!
And yesterday, it was all, "let's keep giving @crazyman crazy scores and see how long we can keep him playing!" :D
heh geek...did he pass out last night or actually say good night and sign off?
@nkem, can you code us a private chat?
Some of us will get to play for free to provide them comedy. "Did you SEE what @geek2nurse thought was the right path?!?"
@ketta, I'm good 98hey crazy, how do you color your cell body?
"Oh look, they're SOOOO excited about a cell body, isn't that cute?"
50? 40
Was that a correct film quote?
are you sure you aren't mapping a chicken's legs?
anyone talk to me?!
what's up xanman
xanman, still have a shark?
did yooouu do that as well? :D
ah, that's why you knew the one I had problems with?
why those major gaps? :D
what was supposed to happen?
one click cell body, anyone ? :D
is rprentki around? Think merger on cell 33, cube 51563, 2 seed pieces, separate paths
trailblazing is limited to 1000?
ain't that  the half of the 1st person?
ketta, did you also mention the new cell body in the mail? :D
graps?
hello? anyone?
what's up xanman?
what ketta says :D
we'll be here when you come back
why u think so, xan?
uh, guys?
I keep getting cubes with tiny slivers of cell along the edge that seems to be complete. Is that normal?
that's what happens...he put a big ol' target on his back by going nuts with his score :)
those 2000-ish cubes today were pretty useful, eh? :D
how early was it that it happened?
yes :D goal today was to beat my own PB, but why not go all the way :D
a5hm0r took carzyman' score personally?
playing video games is a life, right?
well, when you try to get no life for a dy, the have the nack to remember that you do have one and that those responsabilities wont take 
What if I fill out a cube  wrong? I'm weirded out that I could make monumental mistakes. Am I the only one?
really?
I had this cube I am 100I really have no idea why one would like to have a opaque plane...
ever see scoobie doo? silly cartoon...
is the plan to eventually follow all those neurones that are in all these images?
I *think* that's what Seung is really interested in atm
(what's atm?)
how do you turn off the chat thing
I avoid the longer ones, but I use the shorter ones sometimes. especially when texting, without a full keyboard
the whole chat or just the *bling*?
just try to think of what it's worth to science... :P
So on a SAC cube, if I add a whole bunch of stuff and get only 40 points, does that mean I probably marked the wrong stuff?
Any idea when the challenge will be public?
anyone ran into a cube without 3d recently?
Is it a SEC cell body though?
well they all need a cell body don't they?
I am sure this is, what hsseung would do know
What is the cause of celebration?
is it any good?
did they say when it's gonna be open again?
whats uo, mrlindsey?
Why?
which brings you the reall thing without  having a clue about what you're doing
no i did the tutorial! I skipped the practice is what I meant
The practice gives you feedback when you're doing it yourself -- great learning.
question is, why are you doing this?
SO school is teaching how to color within the lines on line now???
What happened to all those things called pen and paper Mr. Lindsey?
How are the 2D images retrieved? MRI?
Digitalized (pixilated?)
Right, TEM = Internal, SEM = External?
 so what do you guys do for a living?
@Geek: How many years post-grad is NP, and in what type of school? 
Dang. My little skinny ganglion just buried itself in a giant mass that takes up half the cell. I have no idea what to do with this.
I guess it's because we're getting close to the cell body?
so where are ya'll from?
are the boutons the part that holds the neurotransmitters?
 how many points you got doe
hooveszimmer where you at tho
How do I stop this trailblazing madness?
I'd like to know how you get on the blazing trail. I have never yet seen that I have trailblazed.
It's not worth it, you get get many points.  It's when you get to be the first one to trace the segment in the cube.
i keep getting over 300 points, how do i stop?
How about Shut Up?
what's going on people?
What's an EXPLICATIVE?
a5h is still around? 
aiming for 80k?
Ketta, how can one earn more than 50 pts for trailblazing?
you get retroactive points for what you normally would have gotten for the cube once others do the same cube
I guess you have to be faster when tracing, before other folks finish the same cube aehead of you
even if I sucked at getting the points, wouldn't it say that I'd trailblazed a cube if I had?
yes. once you work a cube, you either see how points you've gotten for it or it tells you you trailblazed a cube
*how many
I don't know why I called dfawcett as 'she'
Because of Farrah, MJ? ;)
and even then, sometimes still not believed, depending on where you are..
here it's not so bad, but on wow, even when girls talk on voice chat they're still called "he"
Is this circular shape with concentric lines called boutons?  Reminds me of a Merkel cell (receptors on the skin surface)
what assumption?
dau = daughter?
hey, no joke. You need your programs testet by DAU. They'll find problems where you never expected some...
but couldn't get points the second time around. anyway, for what it was worth...
ANY BVN KIDS!?!?!?!
Are you guys getting less branching cubes?
How many points to you have so far?
WHAT
waaaa???
you only yolo once right?
how do you have 7000
What else do you think I do
why? she's  cute girl.
why beat me anyway?  aim for beating ash!
you were at 700, which was the next 1000 from where I was
nkem?
what's up rinda?
hey everyone. what's up?
does anyone else have to reset their plane opacity every time they play?
what score did he stop at?
at least 78K from when I saw it earlier
that means it's correct?
interesting how that works :)
would be kinda neat if they rotated how the days worked, would probably see more international top scorers
well, when you get up and see a top score and know you've got all day to try and beat it, it's sort of incentive
when you can stay up until the very end..I imagine it'd change a little bit
school stuff?
oh, interesting...do you get projects you have to do or do you choose your own?
ah, that's sort of what I meant...but I'm not a programmer by any means
good luck :) how do you think you'll do?
big prize at stake?
hate that... I tend to draw them all out if I can and see what looks right :(
so where is echo?
my guess? in bed, sleeping
where?
when chat starts up
the message of the day?
What color do you want to be? :)
But aren't I supposed to be red then?
?
what'd you think?
but I didn't get why he said: "Thanks for this *provocative* speech"
Do you regret the harlem shake already? :D
btw, what is this neverending axon at the SAC?
I mean, does this really belong to another SAC as well?
oh?
that would explain why we thought it is the same cube but you couldn't find it...
oh, you lost the red color? that is mean!
what is that supposed to be?
how can i disable the sound of the chat ?
has anyone told the reaper about extra cell body on J #7 yet?
but dont i disable the complete sound with it ?
thats what i said, yes :D
oh sry only read what i wanted to read ^^
echo did you forget to double trailblazing points on SAC?
pink? :D
hey ketta, you there?
and easeful echo?
I hope we'll get to know where this long path ends today...
Btw, did you know that continuous learning can damage your brain? :D
At least, that's what I understood :D
when is there ever too little data
when your variance is too high so you can't interpret it :D
and if i find not really much and the neuron stops in the mid of the cube ... is this likly ?
hmm this is what i heard so i got curios .)
echo?
yes?
bug or fix w/ refresh?
echo is admin or just really good bot ? .D
oh, rprentki or echo still here?
black path: ?
green path: ?
pruned?
that explains our different thoughts, what black means :D
mods?
echo...echo...echo?
/msg reb1618 would you care to quickly test some new code to see if it misbehaves for you?
/msg echo can you see me on chat? I'm on the test
/msg echo out of curiosity, what "broke"?
/msg echo want me back on regular site?
ew?
onion cake?
your roommates don't think much of you eh?
Why? I got some, too :D
what's the update?
hey, is anyone else getting an out of cubes message?
Which cell?
Does anyone here know very much about nueroscience?
echo, something I could test for you?
Or however it's spelled?
And I heard how it's spelled :)
Hm, some basic information might be found in the wiki. Did you check that out?
anything broken?
pixel resolving? Did you add mipmapping, again?
if I click for new version will I be as you all are now?
echo, again on vacation? :-P
every single image shows the checkerboard pattern as it loads, no matter how long i've been sitting idle on a frame
high traffic today?
when i'm done with this cube
?
good karma?
 the brain of a mouse, right?
pink, eh ash?
my present cube has one completely blurry image, should I report it? how?
it's just that one image is almost white when the others aren't
happens when you work with stuff only nanometers think
Umm... rprentki... do you by any chance have the results of this one cube, that kept me awake for 2 nights?
oh um, you emailed about it?
ooOH, the one with the nutso merger?
Did something change w/ latency?
feeling nauseous from pixels? @ketta?
compared to some minutes ago?
what are you going on about?
and look in the log what points you people get. :D
when there is a disagreement in the cube it won't be easy to guess I guess :)
ok so the consensus right now is that it is slightly slower than earlier?
why because people keep changing their minds? :)
wait can someone else reproduce that?
oh, so it behaves like the color transparency? *evil grin*
I have an idea what might be causing your problem twister, working on the fix now
echo, mine stayed this time...might have had 2 windows open??
has anyone (a yellow person) helped you yet?
hey echo ...are you around?
oh, so quitting time is correct? Ha, I like "beer o'clock". But my dictionary says, thats the australian version...
speaking of clocks, when does the EyeWire day begin, eastern US time? (I'm central)
how's it going!
is echo gone for the day?
I totally forgot to ping you when I was in SF by the way !! 
reb you get 500k or something?
ketta, are you on break?
what do you work on/study blackblues?
pleuripotency for mpb?
SCs?
what are you working on reb?
Would you consider yourself as a fast eyewirer?
who?
but it wouldn't make sense to give a cube to multiple people the first time...how would it work?
thx echo. Are you lurking until I tell BS? :D
and what about the accuracy if you're just fast?
but then if you and someone else are both assigned to it, what nkem said applies
but if you're not accurate enough, you'll never get assigned a 0?
only your accuracy or compared to others online? 
hey...i saw crazy ask about the TB points for SAC...is that on purpose?
just a small peek, maybe? :D
got to be fast if you're the only one one it, right?
eek, they were...removed again? 
again? he's been revoked multiple times? o.O
hm?
nkem? never nkem
i dont know what im doing
anyone know why double click on 3d stops working sometimes?
Was the tutorial not helpful, zherstek?
What still works is:
and where did you get stuck, zerhstek?
or is it more the gerneral "hopefully I don't mess up"-feeling you have, zherstek? :D
/msg echo Maybe a small chat command like "showaccuracy"? :D
nah it is more like "i have no idea what is going on"
/msg echo I can't belief how much this bugs me :D
have you seen the videos posted on the blog?
videos?
And that's the link to *all* tutorial cubes: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6ENAPXN9Lc&list=PL-IggV222ozRiKUehYTkFaW1T5rQ1iChs
that better?
what have you changed, echo?
I thought only the 2d view?
Where should I see this?
2d should be faster when you jump to an unloaded slice
is submitting things really slow for everyone? or just me
What can we learn from that? Parallel download > sequential! :D
amazing what a difference you made nkem.
huh?
why to I feel left out
wait grizle, it's faster for you now?
I don't know...is your loading fast?
what I'm noticing is that it takes much less time for pieces I add to show up in 3D, MUCH LESS
"Oh boy, that was unintended" - echo accidently fixed something? :P
it's the antithesis of things breaking when you're trying to fix something else
after the first update this afternoon, I changed my bandwidth pref from low to high. Any chance that had anything to do with the trlblazing?
does the plane always start in the center now?
or perhaps with the reference to it appearing in my chat?
What's with the low resolution
the checkerboard you mean?
@billock, have you refreshed since the update?
bandwdith?
I am still not sure, when chrome looks for new files by itself..
sucked when I first got on but after the new version installed it was much better
and your blue update bar forces a reload?
Just one thing: If you click on the gear  (next to the speaker): Is bandwith set to "high" or "low"?
should it be high or low?
oh, we found another cell body?
still having trouble with the checkerboard coming up with each click any suggestions ?
and if you click on it, you get the checkerboard?
and does it go away after a short time?
click? or do you mean scrolling through the layers?
that's typical when the site is slow...but it shouldn't be that bad now. 
I think he means when he's scrolling up/down
ok, 3 people with heavy problems right now, correct? gisela, billock and davis
For everyone else it's the same or even better?
Hm, maybe a browser specific thing? (Would be strange)
when I'm paying attention :)
and now it's much better...function of the number of users?
only when there are a lot of users...
galarun... galarun... ah, right. Had a BSOD again?
no new records today? they exhausted themselves?
nkem where is the cube id shown?
found it nkem...did you just trace the one that looked right, left the rest untraced?
you didn't get 1200 for this cube?
how do you do that ketta?
does anyone know if the easy cubes get given to has many people?
or if they 'retire' the very clear one earlier?
everyone still have cubes?
lasts an even shorter time when nkem emails me to tell me you guys found it
has it been all night?
i know a few people are working, just not sure how many
hmm, everyone went to bed?
I played wow a bit yesterday too.. everyone was all "omg where have you been?! oh, we know.. hockey"
except really it was eyewire?
playing or watching?
I stop fine when there's boards nearby.. :)
that's how i stop at the roller rink---run into the wall
what's the most clutzy thing you've done ketta?
today or ever?
I get bruises all the time too.. most of the time, I have no idea where they come from
i'm not a clutz when I'm driving though, wheels I can handle :P
it was interesting seeing what the insides looked like, but too many little screws to risk losing
industrial, like a case or the whole phone?
nice :) is that a compass on the outside?
thanks! it was about 1000 pieces/ i think thats the point system? 1 point per piece? :)
it's mostly the volume filled in and how well your work compares to work done by others
what ketta said
when you get a big ol' nasty cell body, just submit it
did you get a screenshot? :D
Why are we still awake?  How do you do a screen shot?
loading slow?
is that's what's new? I've had it happen before...
so you've been awake for 72 hours crazyman?
@galarun without a computer?
Professor Seung?
what's your question?
Where does the funding come from?
when did they change the image loading?
how do you mean? 2D or 3D?
why did you like it better before robert?
he does drop in once in a while to chat, and they sometimes to google hangouts, but I don't know when the next one is
Imagine if there was a kickstarter like option to help funding?
That is one of the goals, right? Get as many people involved as possible so we can map the cells faster.
there we go! Sorry for bonmbarding chat with random words! How is everyone!
@smalljude I'm going to send you a pvt message in chat to illustrate how this works for the blog
hmm does anyone remember how to make the gay lines say something? 
as in where points are reported?
Has anyone else problems with the slow loading time?
Is the site today a bit slower for everyone, or just me?
what happened to SAC?
huh what happened to the sac cell :x
how is the speed today
which cell and what's your bandwidth/locale rinda?
so who wants multiple colors to paint with?
need a tester?
trying to figure out what to make first
is one additional color sufficient?
I know what I'd personally like but haven't read forums, etc
then it changes to the regular new color when you place the next piece ... and that next piece is now the different color.
wdoze?
does ctrl+z not work?
how to unfreeze then?
hey ketta...didn't have to change your plane opacity did you?
what now?
does anyone know why the cursor changed?
affects how I implement multicolored paint
fixed bug where ctrl+z reopens chat window and changes text, instead of eyewire selection
crap I just missed what you said w/ the refresh
anyone want to design us a favicon?
what's that?
oh, is that your favicon idea? :D
you got a 500 error?
when I try to submit or skip now
can you submit now?
nice, what's it beign used for?
I had trouble logging in today - had to make another account.  login name box would not accept the letters s,w ro x.  Any ideas?
where should I send it to? support?
hm?
clicking doesn't remove focus from the text box anymore?
Is there a way to load all of the images for a cube up front so that scrolling between the slices is more smooth?
it still takes a little bit to load all of the images when you get a new cube or switch orientation.
so what does not loading smoothly mean?
you're getting a lot of checkerboards?
what's your bandwidth?
echo, have you considered this SPDY stuff?
Shouldn't I see this in header files? :D
echo, are you here?
what kind of little buggy?
so they can go live in someone else's software?
that's what I was just thinking! :D
she tries to chase them, and when pushed too far they all start to chase her. Fun times, all across the house
when they'd yip and irritate her, she'd literally put her foot down
i don't think he knows what that means
on sac?
how are u and where u guys from
how are u
where u from
how old are u
how old r u
what??
about what?
what just happened lol
how r u
what are u doing
oh, cell body #5?
wait what
I think those were all, or?
wait what i am so confused
I'm pretty sure this is very close to how it behaved 3 days ago
how much do you get paid for this?
anyone else's shift function not working?
what did people just say I refreshed
how much do you get paid for this?
do you get paid for the poiunts?
what doesn't work jakko?
but when I talk in the chat
when you click in 2d it doesn't deselect chat
is that enough?
wait, alt does already?
alt? what does alt do?
esc?
I have a score?
Not sure how many people use "w" and "s"
what about the arrow keys?
what is not a big deal ketta
also the results table when you've finished a cube
what is the point of this game?
yeah I haven't found a computer where I can reproduce it yet, so it's hard for me to fix
this game is annoying, what is the point of it?
did you try the tutorial? :D
and it didn't help?
up to date version, ibisenc?
I have a windows machine at home, I'll try it when I get there
can you link to the article that said that?
you mean in firefox?
Let's see how much you owe me, echo :D
monies?
what, no link?
u r?
echo?
yes?
oh, thats funny, I always say echo when no one post for a while @ echo
what happens if you accidentaly get a tiny bit wrong and submit it?
that's why multiple people trace the same cube
what if i color in everything
Is j6 completed?
hm saving is quite slow for me, others too?
wait, echo, do you work for eyewire?
what do you mean?
?
yes, that is why we are always nice to him :D
are people allowed to cuss on the chat?
rprentki?
3d in gameplay? or the overview?
others having the same issue?
@ghost: My gran taught me to keep my words soft and sweet, 'cause one never knows when one will have to eat them...
uh, ash?
yeah? what's up :D
whats funny?
ash is agirl!?
/me asks why
why a trout?
why not cod?
or bass?
they are rinda, one of my favourites...they taste good too, but I don't get them often. highly restricted where I live
where u live, ketta?
y cant u eat fishies?
?????????? ?????? :)
Why am I so bad at this? I pretty much only get 20 points
what @kintbr
?
is there usually a lot to fill in per cube?
how do u trailblaze
trailblazing is when you're the first one to work on a cube jakko
have either of you seen the videos posted on the blog?
no where?
what is trailblazing?
echo?
is it prefered that we not skip small cubes ?
you are in the tutorial?
?
are there a lot of cubes that are like already basically done?
I keep getting cubes where I feel like they're complete... I go over the whole thing and there's maybe a tiny piece to fill in
 is an admin on?
what does it mean to trailblaze a cube?
that's what i thought
How many cell bodies are left on SAC (probably)?
3?
Don't even know what I'm look at.
GrimReaper here?
how are kitties?
how yo guys going? hey furball, congrats for yesterday
any news from amy tonight?
What exactly is the prize?
acknowledgement and honor? Or something more material?
Who enjoys trailblazing cubes? Who makes an effort to train the noobs? We do... We do... *clink*
http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/04/10/magazine/radiolab.html?_r=0
seen that?
just trying to understand why its becoming so slow..but I do
rmissel i was wondering that too? seems to have gotten really slow lately
speed check?
echo?
any comments on performance today?
same as before?
3d slow also judy?
what kind of internet are you on?
Roadrunner wireless to cable - does that make sense?
alguien que me esplique como va esto en espa�ol?
echo did you change something recently, last hour?
what seems different?
was wondering why you were asking
@marika, fast 3d, slow 2d?
seems same as yesterday but not as good as when you first made change parallel vs serial loading
@reb how about compared to last week
so it was better yesterday, worst monday, and same last week?
@reb mind refreshing and telling me same/worse/better?
oh skewing the data huh? of course I'm so sleep deprived I can't tell mon from tues
2) our servers seem to be slower than normal, so I'm not sure how much of the issue is from my code
eek don't even say that rinda, if you mean what I think you mean :P
err, checkerboard, that's what I call it
@judy mind asking your location?
are you the one from st louis area?
CDN?
Thanks! - and my last cube before work - what a bonus.
love it when it work like that :)
echo, are there consequences for skipping a cube? Affects what you get next?
hm?
echo, are there consequences for skipping a cube? Affects what you get next?
just seems like it then...human brain likes to find patterns when there aren't any
why can't I play the starburst cell?
dear reaper, I believe it is ok to skip if there's a real issue with a cube, not if it's too hard?
why do you skip?
the only time I skip is when the seed is so screwy that it's impossible to find a starting point...
marika--if you're unsure, post an image in the forum--under the Help What is Thi section
you know, those really gnarly ones, that most likely have a merger error and even by going to overview you can't see what's what
rprentki, do you know if Jcell #7 if a different kind? has a different feel/shape to it
thx for confirmation. and many more boutons?
and we're leaving the name up there until we figure out what it is
it seems to have alot of bulbous bits. is that what people have been seeing?
oh no, ketta, you're out of SAC?
but now you're good?
see?? no one should spell that wrong on a test
reb-cell ??
CZ cell?
What kind is OSGC?
me too! what are you supposed to do - just submit as is or skip?
so what's the deal with skipping cubes? why is it so bad to do it
i skip cubes when i think i am completely wrong and can't figure out a better way... but now i won't
is there ever a time when it's good to skip?
what happens if my 4 year old gets hold of the computer and colors the whole cell and hits submit?
what does that mean
@lily mergers are when two things smush together that shouldn't, like two branches
there are some screens under the 'what is this?' post on the forums
when you find those...get the cube id (type /debug) and send it to support@eyewire.org
969 points!?
what's up luken
this new cell body... is this really a SAC?
/msg nkem oh yeah? that's cool! I'll try that the next time I email them.
oh, echo fixed tb-points?
Is the woman with the virtual scythe and an enourmos hatred for merged paths online?
something like this?
whats the recommendation when theres part of 2 neurons (2 colours) in one cube? complete them both?
I am not sure what you mean with "2 colours"
Is the other one yellow?
o.O?
What is your normal AI color?
why is my game running so slow?
rillabee: slow in general? Or only this cube?
Check the gear on the lower right. Is the bandwith setting on "low"? If so, try "high" and try a hard refresh of the page.
Echo changed the way how 2d-slices are loaded.
oh, did he say what?
Hm, sry. no other idea what to do about it... For me it works really fast at times, and then again really slow some hours later
*you got ?t I think :)
lol...anyone here ever read the book of dave?
Any good?
and when the apocalypse came, it was somehow preserved and worshiped like the Bible
it's a good read, but difficult at first because of how it's written (kind of phonetic, takes some getting used to)
cool... one cube with two autpases. Aren't those rare, normally?
does webGL keep crashing for anyone else? like in the middle of a cube?
what kind of crash?
"lost context"? Or blue screen of death?
the screen freezes, i have to reload the page, where i get a "rats! webgl failed to load" or some kind of error like that from Chrome
heavy cubes?
with a lot to fill in, I mean?
so I guess this isn't really happening for other people? I dunno, my chrome's been a little funky lately
Hm, maybe after a long session? Right now, my Google Chrome uses 1000MB as the task manager tells me...
everythin looking smooth? Then it's probably correct :)
What is the hot key for zoom on left view panel?
sadly I can't say how it works for you
maybe some weird finger magic on the right side of the pad?
so, "pinch" is not working?
any way to get into the Starburst Private Beta?
did you get my email?
are you still out of cubes?
aw...how's she doing? ..and a couple more have popped up, i'll move back over to SAC in just a minute
did you guys notice if anyone else ran out of cubes as well?
maybe there aren't enough ppl doing the starburst challenge?
i.e. maybe they're not online today?
Hey, hsseung, did you get the URL I sent you about the CME thing?
didn't get the URL abt the CME. did you email it?
who is susi?  new #1?
I like job security. That's why I went from software dev to psych. :)
shouldn't I be darker aqua now?
oh well, amy will have to fix it when we see her next I guess :)
ok ketta, you're supposed to be light blue now?
will you stay light blue day after tomorrow?
I get to stay this colour now, right?
ok, so you're supposed to stay darker blue forever?
wow rprentki waves her magic wand and look what happens
maybe when a mobile version comes out, you can take it to work...for breaks :P
allergies?
or a cold?
haha same here.  When i was living in italy I couldn't find sunscreen with double digit spf, it was all like 8
Where are you, furball?
has to do w/ Ca conversion/absorption? I think
hey ketta, more cubes for you now?
will there still be double points?
and are you starting a new one, or continuing this one?
is it harder, or just different?
fewer boutons I could live with...?
plus you sometimes have to get creative when you know that branches have to go all the way across the cube
yup more mergers, that happens when the branches are so thin
Except when I don't. :)
me too.  sometimes start over to get them right... when I do.
Seriously? Awesome!!!
yeah..so now what do I do? :P
Foldit? lol
feeling blue today?
I've found that to be true so far, at least where I'm at as an undergrad
i keep getting cubes where it looks like the ai didnt need any help. is this common?
I always get the coolest ones when I need to stop and go to sleep.
Wow, did grimreaper have a go at the SAC, or is it just not redrawing on my screen? It looks 'way cropped back.
That's no fun. I like to see how it's looking.
if you get a chance check and see if it's still there?
it's sort of hard when you guys are spotting them from the overview
haha, i'm only counting the SAC challenge, it's when we started keeping track
you excited for the SAC challenge later today Rinda?
blackblues posted a favicon idea on the forum, what does everyone think?
rinda want to try and make a more wire-y one?
Whois brain?
/msg amyleerobinson hey amy, you around?   Mark and I just relaunched the starburst challenge, I posted on the blog and fb
ketta, how many over 1 million are you?
why am i yellow?
i wonder if it's rachael or echo?
you're yellow eh?
yeah...but I know why now :P
what team was that ketta
actually, either today or tomorrow I'll teach you how to send me coordinates for mergers in the overview
ooh, shadowy?
say something else?
i'd love to learn how to give you more info on mergers
echo and I just figured out how to make it work,I just need to finish writing the instructions
/msg rprentki with caps: GrimReaper ??
/msg reb1618 yes?
not a merger?
hey reb, you want to learn about mergers?
/msg rprentki was wondering if it needed G and R caps like when you told me to type it
so, this is basically a way to report them directly rather than via email?
soon.  And ketta,you know how you guys see mergers in the overview sometimes, but can just send a picture or describe it?  not a cube?
are they related to coordinates in debug or is that cube-specific?
yup, same coordinates as in debug, but you'll be able to get them when you're looking at the overview
this is what I mean by screenshots, people do this on occassion
ketta do you have gchat or something?  it occurs to me this might be easier if we don't have other people cluttering up the chat
?
oh dear, everything ok?
you're pink?
What's up with the progress bar ?
ooh, is it asking you to do the SAC tutorial again ash?
wait, were you one of the ones who got through the SAC tutorial in just a couple of cubes?
Euhm could be, I was one of those that got through when there were still problems with the challenge
ah I think I know what's going on
yes? :)
you got through the tutorial too quickly, in just a few cubes, so when we relaunched it you had to be set you back to the beginning so it 
ok ketta, reb, ready?
seems good on my end sliet..have your refreshed lately?
mine went way better when i closed to the router
and you'll notice that you get a lot more detail when you zoom in on something
see the grey blob on this cell?
so there's no other 'key' way to zoom the cell? coz the scrollbar on my touchpad is not working
@mbruce doesn't work at all?  all touch pads are different so it may just be needing to figure it out
yup, what do you have?
i clicked where it attaches to branch, have 2966, 3064, 2767 plus decimals
i'm assuming decimals are too much info?
would you prefer two sets of coordinates that delineate the merger branch?
...and the cell #?
so let's talk about how to spot mergers
it was actually clear when i could see entire cell, then had to look deeper
yeah...same, when I've seen mergers
is there a way to rotate the 3d image of the cell created? i find i am having trouble distinguishing between a branch and a second cell
are mergers mostly due to errors in mapping or following AI mergers?
@ward2jm, there are lots of hints if you click on the ? on lower right of screen
@rprentiki: thank you. no idea how i missed that. 
so you guys saw the picture I just linked?
you guys could just pull a coordinate off of that merger, and it'd tell me there was a merger, but not where it started
and where it starts is what you'd like :)
so what you would do is zoom in, and try and move along the branch, and look for places where the merged branch touches the cell
@reb she was just saying that on that obvious merger...what they're looking for is coords to where it starts
so what I'd like you guys to do if you find them is to email support@eyewire.org  but address it to me (or the GrimReaper) and just give us 
I don't know how much email you get at support
in osgc 3, there's a small black piece floating a little outside the the edge of the cell, what are the coordinates?
edge of cell or cell body?
echo made a bug and hasn't fixed it yet, so now stuff is black when it's growing
rprentki, found a couple of snippets of screens that where the bouton looked like an eye.  can't do much with it right now, basement is floo
you pass ash?  how many cubes did it take?
what's up with boutons and eyes?
thx :) Was the result of the closed beta positive ?
and it was good, we learned what went wrong
rprentki, anything else for now? I have a meeting in about 15 mins
lesson plans for what class?
american, european, world?
Not when I keep getting these little cells - in a corner or on an edge.
ok so what number does it say you're on now?
and that's why we require 80wait, so did you have the progress bar the entire time before?
you said above 95 on all? that is weird
super weird. well let's see what happens
how's it going lily?
hello?
how are things going?
great! just finishing up the tutorial.. how about with you?
where are you from?
you?
Oregon?
Any other Boston-ites?
 I get really bad at his game when I don't play for a couple of days
you mean you don't have dreams where you practice? :)
mixed hair and lice??? well you would have an idea with your hair
SAC?

do they have something else in line?
i'm sure they do, I just don't know for sure what yet
I know amy mentioned some olfactory neurons that were very different, but not sure when on those
did you do all the cubes from all the cells?
sac is just weird because of how things have to go across cubes and that we didn't always have a lot of people working on it
is there mroe people on the sac now that it's back up?
and that may be what's going on... or something got snipped. I went from 40+ cubes to nothing in an hour, and I know I didn't
I know, but when I can't see my way through I just feel like I should not do it
did you have a good week off?
ok let me see what I can whip up,
anyone else mention they were out of cubes?
rprentki, could you take a look at cube 53053?  I traced it a couple days ago and there looked to be a huge merger issue
hey galarun I will in a few minutes and let you know what's up
is there a way to report incorrect segmentation?
do you mean mergers?
when different parts come together that shouldn't?
so the merger space is figured out automatically?
not sure what you mean by merger space?
when I click on a nearby region, it becomes selected
how does it know the extent of the area selected?
ah, I see what you're saying..and I'm not sure how the ai knows
so you clicked on something, and something else was selected too?
rprentki, will you please look at my cube?
galarun, you mean the cube you're on now?
look in the 3D, do they look like they fit together?
can you see the 2D?
why do others have flags next to their name but not me?
where are you from?
do you have ambiguous isp galarun?
hmm, you on a university?
ok galarun, I assume you're talking about that WEIRD loop?
what do you mean by unregulated?
so I can only see what the consensus is, so what everyone agreed
was the weird piece of neuron going through/across the correct piece?
if you trace a cube do you not ever get to again?
as I recall the connection had the other nueron going under it, where it continued out perpendicular to include about a third of the screen
what do you mean by loops?
maybe?
neurons going through the middle of others?
is that true?
it's like when your fingers make the 'OK' sign
how do I turn chat sounds off?
so, I've encountered neurons that seemingly branch off and then reconnect, is that not possible?
so... no?
that make sense?
that's the first thing I thought of when I saw one
is that in the FAQ?
onion? silent g?
how much actual empty space is there in a cube...I realize there's no absolute answer...
ha! @couc how interesting :)
do you mean how much stuff are you not coloring
or how much actual emptry space there is between the cells?
how's it going!
you were yellow when I left!
Want me to put you back purple ketta?
woke me right up when I saw I was yellow this morning!
how much of the space is occupied :)
that's not how you spell that
hahaha nkem would love how you spelled that :D
it's pretty much how I spent most of my spring break :P
you ever read the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy?
Do any of you dream this, following paths in your sleep?
one time when I had a bad cold
what do u mean pahts?
paths?
I don't dream it...but sometimes when I look away I see the grid and connections
do u guys know about ndes??
what were you saying about having a cold rprentki?
can you manipulate the mental image?
what I really want to do is hook up a network analyzer to a neural network and "sniff" the wire...
any admins out there?
it would be a mess...probably not too stateful?  :)
can you tell us the cube ID?
the blue piece, yes?
someone said admin?
cna you trace through it?
@andane what's up?
the blue piece, yes?
what is the GrimReaper, is that the AI?
so when too many people can't figure out a cube, the cells stop growing
how are you cubes ketta?
hi amy, flight go OK?
unless you think it's better i do those to try and spawn more?
and ketta and reb will get to use it when the find mergers for the Reaper
what the heck
why can't I make yours blue!
hopefully I didn't mess anything up last night, I changed ketta and what furball?  so they were the right colors
@andane which promo you mean?
galarun I don't recognize your name, have you been playing for a while? 
speaking of which.. i've been doing the SB beta but should I be doing the other cells?  for science....
sb is where it's at at the moment
the starbursts are what we want info on for our paper
i just want to work on what is the most useful/helpful
why are scores so low? yesterday I thought it was the light at work I couldn't get anything but it didn't get any better when I got home.
Where's Ketta!
Nice, what kind ?
Trailblazing?
@reecer trailblazing is when you do a cube first
you get 50 points for doing that, and more points later (what you'd normally have gotten for doing that cube)
it's fixed?  what was wrong?
hi echo, rprentki, how's eyewire today?
I don't understand how all these horizontal lines get unfiltered right in the middle of the things.
@reecer6, on the 2d? white lines?
i used to get those in my SEMs all the time when "stray electrons" were flying around, difficult to deal with contrast & interference
osmium or uranyl acetate?
I should be asking you; how's eyewire today
and happy Friday, how's the color options going?
wundertool?
why would we do that?
do the cubes belong to multiple cells, depending on what the AI picks out? Are they all integrated in one study/data collection?
is there a limit on # of cells you can track? Dependent on # of fluorescent dyes?
ah, ok. Thanks, always curious about how things work. I work on such small cells, this is a different perspective
I can see how it can be addictive 
wait what
why am I pink-purple?
do you know what that score is?
what's yours?
time to get it back eh?
are you getting cubes without much to ad?
yeah but modst of the ones I get have  few points.  Even when I fill in parts of the cell based on the overview and the other connections to
don't know how to do that
when in reality only the highest show up--we used to have it show all scores but it was too much
Is anyone else experiencing very slow cube download times?
not sure what's up with it
traveling?
btw who was having slow load speeds?
anyone? anyone? bueller?
I think I just passed all the Starburst practice stuff. Is there a way to find out? 
andwhen you submit it will tell you how accurate you were 
when that no longer appears you are done
a way to tell whether it belongs?
and if an admin isn't on in the future, you can post a screenshot in the forum under the Help What Is THis section, you won't get a response
fast enough to help with that cube, but you'll learn what to do in the future
Very cool. How do I post a screenshot?
there's one piece that doesn't belong, can you figure out which one looks wrong?
that's the one I was wondering about -- how should I have known it didn't fit?
hey amy, how's the challenge going so far, anyone out of cubes?
not sure how many have gome through
rprentki I have a strange thing - one section that I traced shows on the 2d but not on the 3d?
where in the cube is it?
is anyone having trouble submitting?
are you guys in the tutorial?
what happens when you submit?
so it spawns when I'm out/low, just slow-ish..no biggie at all :)
have your numbers been going down this evening or staying steady?
@judy when I log in for the first time of the day, I have to do a refresh to start up chat too
does the 3d view work for every one? First time here but my left side is totally blank
just heard the cutest pick-up line from a scientist: "Can I show you my lab?" :D
any new starburst players today?
what do you guys think?
did you graduate to the new level davis?
rprentki - can you take a look at a cell if I give you the number?
`are you in the cube atm?
haha ok, i just need to save what I'm working on, hang on
which of the branches looks correct, just from the 3D?
that's what I think too
yup that's how it goes
hey ketta, still here?
but it's been reloading me from where it dumped me, so it's not been so bad
if you click reload on the oh snap screen, it should put you where it dumped you off
when that happens to me, my monitor learns new combinations of cuss words
my 2d goes crooked sometimes. is there any way to fix that?
crooked? like...off center a bit for a slice, or just not the same orientation as 3D?
I don't use alt+drag unless I'm having issues..and sometimes just going to overview and then going back gets it how i want it
same here...and there i times i *know* what i did is right, and it makes me wonder about other submissions
right..like what happened during the eyewire games
if there's quite a bit that was fairly obvious, then just a little bit past the merge, wouldn't it be more than 40 though?
how's it going! popping in for 5 min before bed :)
GrimReaper? I emailed support about possible merger in J cell #7
am I still pink?
rprentki?
?
is there a GrimReaper around?
do you have a 'better'/different view?
hey jamie, speaking of jobs, did you migrate westward?
that's why I didn't give the 2nd end point...looked too messy
@rprentki, coordinates were correct enough?
does anyone know if the eyewire servers will switch time because of DST?
so that merger actually started a bit further down, the point you sent was where the merger touched J7, but it actually started further down
@rprentki, but you were able to identify? I don't know if I have the same resolution on overview you do, where they merge is tough for me
@rprentki, if you're still here, check 2490, 2907, 2584 ? I'm very unsure of this short bit
which cell reb?
hi amy, still traveling?
how's it going! 
What does your color mean A5hm0r's?
When we looked back at highest scores per day, they tend to occur in clusters
and when the top score is beat, it generally lasts 24 hours 
but it's getting to the point where breaking high score needs to coincide with good cubes/good cell
not sure why one day's score is so highly valued
crap. infrastructure of profiles? Scared now
we can even sorta provide a ratio of how much of a cell a particular player helped build
@jamie and all, what metrics would you like to see?
amy, too big of question. I'm a bit of a stats geek, but I want to know how much 'use' I'm providing...
btw are you all able to see the top scores for the month? mine doesn't display
ok but stats -- what do you all want to see? I'm taking notes :)
will send email amy, too long response for chat, some of the best stats I've seen are 'cubes added'...how much did you help cell grow etc
how so ya change teams?
@gwinks, what do you mean?
what's an evolver rank?
just not sure if ya can chose what group Im with
We have a postdoc whose whole job it is to figure our how to do that
@gwinks, what group? the cell you're working on?
any admins on? I need some advice here
/msg amyleerobinson do you a moment to take a look at this cube i'm on?
Any one have any suggestions?  Today, I often finish a cell, click 'I'm finished' but never get points.  Have refreshed, restarted, etc.. 
How to clear me cache?
did you here the sound after you clicked submit?
OK - thanks.  But restarting browser probably clears it?
server time?
Are you going for a top score now that the star is live again?
I don't know what to do with ones like these, where it doesn;t seem to follow any lines, & everything happens in little pieces
is it best just to skip cubes I don't understand? Or do my best? Or give up?
I know, weird right?
do you find a lot of cubes you're unsure about?
so try taking screenshots of the ones you have issues with, you can post them in the forum under Help What is This?!?!
that way you can skip it and learn what to do next time
I feel like an idiot, but I couldn't figure out how to do the screen shot & couldn't find that section -- I thought I'd ask my son for help 
maybe it saves the shot, then I paste it on a post?
well on my linux work computer it just saves it to the desktop, let's see what it does here at home
Macs save to desktop too. I remember having more to do when I had a pc.
bah, I have no idea where it's going
are you on a pc jen?
how do see the cube number?
when you press print screen
oh?
what color should be for cube champion!
light bright green maybe?
how about another blue amy?
ha yea that's what I was thinking
rachel I'm going to turn you old top score blue so we can see how they look
how's this for top cube count?
?
ok with your color jamie? 
how is this color for top daily cube score? 
and jamie since you can only be one color, if/when you have top cube score you want me to just leave you blue?
My tablet is wifi only, and anyone who can figure out how to turn on the WebGL should know it's a data hog, so that's not a problem.
you're really going for the top?
Is rprenski still there?
I was on my way to grab some food when I ran into my boot
how can you tell?
cool, and you say another bcause there's already one?
do they tend to 'hang out' with other body cell? cause I had 
how can you know? 
Know what ?
http://puu.sh/2rc4O - it's quite clear here where the merge error is
the bigger one?
You can get more than 1000 points now?!?
Does anyone else get headaches from doing this?
is your connection fast enough?
crazy, what did you do with the body cell merger finally? cause I have it now
except the cubes where you can get 2k points :D
tomorrow? :D
what
not to be sorry at all, I'm just wondering what to do with them
dr. seung submit it with no change?
That's what Amy said last time...
Is one of those cell bodies there right one ?
I don't really know how the phone numbers there work
that's what I remember from the cartoons I watched when I was younger :P
Grim is looking for eggs?
Oh, what a great picture...
how do you hide something in air? :D
should I skip or submit this one?
I'll come back when you have clean things up Grim, see you later
nkem still here?
I can click fine in firefox but it is not recognized at all in safari - anyone else have this problem?
crazy, do you intend to 100k today?
have you guys gotten so many points from the sac challenge?
and you have cubes?
what time did you start this morning crazy ?
(when new day in eyewire starts)
has it been loading ok?
any reason for that?
I was thinking 12am was when the internet really got going. lol
oh man! A5h are you in highschool? 
Q: How much time do you spend playing EyeWire? A: A lot. :D
The sound of the chat is soothing ? :p
we used to have it on in lab but when three of us would have the window open it was like being in a windchime shop
what happened to the neuron t-shirt idea?
I hear crazyman and a5h are running low on cubes?
are you out of cubes on SAC?
ok let me see what i can do
oh man us in the top 10?? that's quite a challenge
and go big or go home, right? if trying to be top 10, might as well go all out
@crazyman, how did you find eyewire? 
cool :) what made you stick around? 
any takers? 
How would it be done?
reb, seriously... you are on team echo, team grimreaper... how did you do that? :D
umm, I think I'm only supposed to use team GR when I'm reporting a merger or to...give nkem a hard time :)
MUAHAHA, what a sinisister plan!
nkem, you can't do team echo?
can I still?
and what do you type for green? 
/msg nkem Has rprentki shown you how to report mergers with coordinates? 
nkem, what was the merger in this morning?
what did you eat?
What do you eat to be such a great eyewirer?
wow... and you didnt share???? 
private jet?
hey--if there are two trails through a cube, is there any benefit to doing both, or should we only do the one the AI starts?
what does "two trails" mean?
I've got one now where there is a little spot, according to the overview that's all there is. The overview shows a separate branch also. 
under Help What is THis?!?!
is it a big blob?
really?
did you see what nkem sent in for the merger earlier?
that's awesome! Good one nkem! Who needs greeting cards?
yo whats the trai blazing thing mean?
nkem sometime this week I'll teach you how to find coordinates for mergers, reb and ketta already learned
hey, what's that colour!
how do you change?
?
is anyone able to load the blog right now?
/msg rprentki I think I know how to send you the coordinates. Don't know why I ignored them till now... sry
/msg rprentki ok :) And you need the position of: start, end and merge-point?
/msg nkem just where you think the merger started is fine, and which cell it is (name not number)
/msg amyleerobinson what's a pingback?  the blog just emailed me
good42n still here?
You meant something like this?: http://i.imgur.com/Xcz3rfS.png
just got back--had to reboot. I did get a pci posted under what is this
/msg nkem was that image a merger?
yes, thats what I mean
how many tabs do you have open?
what's your RAM?
@good42n: What you see in the picture is one "volume" - each volume can contain multiple cubes, whereas cube means: One seed piece you have
hey crazy, how many cubes do you have left on the J7?
oh dear, have cubes left on other cells?
what happened to the other cells from the eyewire games?
If I recall correctly, we got about 1000 people that got more than 10.000 points the whole last month?
?
yep?
so sometimes u know how some isnt colored in with in the black around
is it smooth? does it flow?
what I'm supposed to trace?
yea when i look under the neuron all the jaged edges are filled in perfectly
Or do I fill in the core too?
coursera? like free courses?
which is what this game is about ;p
how I can tribalized a cube? Please!
Tatarana, also, when a new cell is added, you have more chances, since almost nothing has been trailed yet.
mom?
we get lower res so the server can handle it?
ok starving, I totally forgot to eat when I fed the kids
of what?
Omg, I am on TV? :D
what time is where you all are?
That's like a goal of eyewire, to map these things, to see what cells connect and where
I think I just hit a merge. I am still in the cube. I pulled the /debug the Cube ID: 51118 Last seg: 4239. I will fig how to capture.
how many cell bodies for SAC are we up to?
is Grim Reaper around to check?
I wonder why there isn't a button to report mergers
which is only 45 days long :p maybe we should open source eyewire, put our to do list public and see what happens 
Amy, do you know by coincidence, which resolution the cubes are?
Isn't it on the wiki?
Umm... is it? I am sooo laaazy :D
@nkem, voxel resolution?
one pixel corresponds to 16nm (nano meter) x 16nm in x-y direction and 22nm in z direction. z direction is where the tissue was cut. 

256x1
So we are working with lower-resolution slices?
I've noticed that sometimes when I "return to overview" and then go back in to the cube it gives it to me in a different perceptive.
Is there a way to make it do that?
@somna, yes, alt+click+drag, click the ?mark on lower right for hints
And that's why you are so fast, crazy :-P
the camera?
why not me?
I don't like where this is going...
cake? what cake?
What type? :P
did I hear 'reb'?
new cell body merger ?
that's what I'm checking
nkem you can check others cubes now?
huh? no
again?
what is it that we should do again?
Oh noes, how did sara get into a cell body?
oh yea when you get to a cell body skip cube 
although, a5h, did you take to do taht?
so you guys can prune out the merger! Right? 
hmm, can I mute amy?
hah why! maybe
And maybe to prune you need consensus from at least 2 grim reapers, right? teamwork
If I think about it... maybe that's why I am not on team echo anymore :D
how did reb went all rainbowy?
and how do you change you color? someone(nkem I think) did it for me earlier
and I'm team grim now?
Are the cell bodies these huge blobs, and should be skipped?
how does one get 72k points in a day?
are all of you level 2 players?
/me don't know what is an level 2 player
what is an level 2 player?
anyone want to take this?
Bye nkem! Teach everyone how *not* to lie :)
/msg nkem did you tell him/her why the lie message showed?
/msg reb1618 whom?
Are the tutorials actually new neurons, or old examples?
otherwise the program couldn't tell you what you did wrong/what you missed, draken ;)
new tutorials? I could use a refresher
I'm assuming the system cross-refernces different people?
is there a way for players to access their accuracy data?
Understanding the basics of how you get points is helpful at the beginning
And I ask myself: How can this be? :D All Level 2 players should know, how to deal with mergers, right? :-P
I've always wondered where those thick columns are headed to
So anyone know who's brain this is?
ah.. does he have a name?
Hey, wouldn't it be a fun idea if all points that came from coloring a merged part were deducted retroactively? :D
did anyone already send a mail?
"Hey, crazyman! You beat the highscore!" - "Woah, really?" - "No, april fools! We deducted the points from all mergers" :D
nkem did you email rachel or support?
On the SAC tutorial, is there anything wrong with stopping at 90not learning how to get those 10I wonder what's the gender ratio in eyewire
Have any cells been completed?
wow?
By the way, did the logo change?
Are you going to do it?
really?
so I just skip?
will we have to do this cell at one point?
yes. but how to know
Is posting my own links ok? :D
400k? :o
@martinj I was emphasizing the 'point' that points earned aren't necessarily a reflection of how well you did
how's it going -- I was just looking at email -- no one has chopped that off yet? ah!
/me is curious as to what everyone's arguing about.
amy, is your conference up yet?
@reb: but does it?
(and where is the ivdeao?)
the what?
What are the rules for the second level of the SAC tutorial again?
@sara, no worries. I know it IS one, was interesting to think of how it may appear to new people. (ty)
is that a merger in the Starburst?
/msg sarabc And that's why moderators can mute or ban people...unfortunately has to be done sometimes
ok then submit without doing something or are there new treatments?
what does it look like?
@millenniumb, on only one slice of the cube?
Amy, are you still here?
think I remember that, is it washed out and pretty pale? few outlines?
Does anyone know what causes that?
what how! and ash youre near 75!!
93K from where I stand
What's the top score at the moment?
/msg amyleerobinson Amy, do you remember our talk some weeks ago? Concerning clearly wrong cubes?
since i'm not used to starburst, is it possible that the small ones get into a "normal" bigger one?
amy? all those cube that get skipped because we're not sure if it's from the merger or the SAC, will they be reset?
Wait, getting 80/msg amyleerobinson I noted all cube ID's where I simply hit submit... you think, this is still necessary? I mean, it's obviously a merger :
what do you mean about skipped cubes
/msg nkem I'm not sure, I sent a note into hq about the merger - what are you asking?
@amy That's what I mean.
is that normal for starburst?
what does it look like in the overview?
I keep having this glitch, where the cube doesn't adjust in position when it opens.
oups, went the worng way on a merger?
However, it is amazing how the wrong cell keeps growing, and the correct one still has tiny ?dendrites?
Yes, pretty sure... I just wonder about the AI and how it chooses new cubes for us...
was going to say...feeling green today?
did I miss anything exciting?
appart from the mother of all mergers?
Is the IFLS Neuron ever going to be removed?
oh, I see the merger..anyone report it yet?
ah :) you got training?
Oh, how did *that* happen? :D
isn't it nice?
Hm?
@reb what team is that for ghosty?
I wonder how many times did the page crash today so far
8 maybe?
How did you get that rainbow name? 
@nkem, noted. What a stupid thing for a microbiologist to say. So... I want an itty bitty scythe!
Ah, do you need to be an admin for that?
oh I need to go look at what they did on FB :P
How's that? :D
Hm. Is there anything I could do to change mine?
and yw amy..who are the two people in the pic?
/msg ketta Did you try '/team grimreaper' ? It's all lowercase
/msg ketta She said today earlier in chat it's only for a day after finding merger... ?
Why do I get exactly 80no, you don't - last time you got 1are you on the SAC challenge Millenium?
/msg reb1618 actually forget it was easter until yesterday, was a baby show for my sister, and now I know why traffic sucked driving home :P
@millenniumb, does it show you the # of cubes you have done at bottom (practice 4 of 6 or something similar)?
You are using the ALT+click+drag stuff ad nauseam? :D
somebody else having a problem with 3d ?
What exact problem?
79??
@acida, it might have something to do with the reaper removing things? They're already getting marked
What happened?
should I continue?
It's a record isn't it?
Wait, he hasn't?
What's the 24 hour record?
That's what I was thinking :P
was there a lot of 2k cubes?
When do you get to "trailblaze"?  Is it in the blog?
trailblazing is when you're the first to do a cell
/msg GrimReaper you are not rprentki again?
oh cool, this one branch looks like it is going upwards... to a new (correct) cell body? :)
see that? http://i.imgur.com/ljWeEpG.png?1
what is trailblazing?
A5 are you trying to catch crazy?
ohm qwerty you are new, right? *Normally* you are not supposed to spend much time on them
what do you mean?
is it crashing your whole computer or just the browser?
oh dear do I need to be watching?
from what i can see the last one was correct too, it just had a merger on the cell body
it should be on the ? tab or something at least
that's why we are purple :D
and btw you are super helpful too...still am amazed at how well supported/maintained this game is
whoops, what was that crazyman? i refreshed as you said something
oh yeah - do you know how many seed pieces we got this time?
(how many cell bodies we *should* find)
I am still wondering how you can tell that precise which piece belongs to a SAC...
so how many seeds are there to do?
nkem, do you mean how can we tell before we give them to you?
Is this due to the "new knowledge" you got? (Blog mentioned something about findings in connection between J-Cell and SAC)
@nkem we went through looking for synapses, tried to figure out what type of cell each was.  SACs have very thin branches, which make them 
I still remember how we started with just 3 cubes
I look at the SAC when there's a lot of stuff up and try to picture it w/ the j-cells, that's challenging
So we are helping to map all the J cells. What use will this be?
so boutons tend to be where the synapses are
both together are what we are interested in, because those types of cells connect
are there any stats on how much progress is being made over time?
crazy, how are you on the other cells
nkem and ketta, you two are ok on cubes?
where are you crazy?
how long hav you been here crazy?
he was on when i went to bed.  yesterday
@rprentki you mean country?
she translated some stuff and wrote it on our white board, but no one remembers what it means >_<
We'll have to ask you when we're back in the office
Is there a paragraph in the ToS about severe damage due to sleep deprivation and such stuff?
eh, if he's under 24 hours should be fine?
oh that is super weird sara, refresh and see if it stops?
the reaper couldn't come by?
tea?
....tea?
how do you all that concertration then?
I don't know, it's just there when I need it
Hmm, are these images at full resolution?
yeah, did you figure out if they were full or downscaled?
is it microns or nm?

you were running up and away? :P
well, our intention was to run away and marry princes, i'm not sure how well we thought that out
climbing a tree... tarzan?
hi, do you know how to minimize or turn off this chat? 
what does trailblazing do/mean?
might be the one I had earlier when I lost the connexion
does anyone still have the link to tiftak's meme? the image I saved of it earlier is corrupted
funny how fast that image got irrelevant
whre are you?
why? ;p
and what Ketta said too
I can't wait to see how many cubes were done today!! The data doesn't refresh until midnight ...
Agree. Did you all see the image of  J Cell #1 superimposed with Starburst branches?
did he call it a day?
curious to see how/if accuracy is impacted
that's what used t be on tv after programmation ended
reminds me of when I was a kid, very comforting :)
what you can't get on a comuter is the silence of the falling snow

what kind of music do you guys listen to?
how was that show? I r jealous!

but this is what i heard ages ago that made me like them
bfe?
don't know what got into me
ketta how do private someone? 
and i figured out why it always looks like you get less than other people...
i couldn't figure out how people seemed to always get more points than I did, then one day it just hit me :P
I like it when I go on another page for my programming class and come back with more points :D
what are you learning?
?
oo?
codeacademy you said?
which perspective?
you'll learn a lot of the why's of ... well, why js is the way it is
Crazyman ended up with 110K points yea?
how's it going!
great, you?
that's why i like this time of night lol. and good night!
is there any staff on right now?
so it's not just me?
what
anyone know how I report weird cube?
or at least have someone look into it?
still pink? nice :D
cube # crazy?
argh, nothing from trailblazing that? you got 2000?
I wonder how many years it's going to take to finish starburst challenge ;-)
@reb that depends on how good we are
@crazy, or how often software merges cell bodies!
so the higher the cube ID the newer it is?
and if you cut of wrong branches/cubes, those IDs are not reassigned?
can't reassign, there's multiple neurons in each cube we're mapping, right? Depends on how they're spawned? hmmm
me, I can't help it. I like to know how things work :)
passed?
test passed? :D
wait it's team grimreaper?
did i steal your power?
maybe?
Btw, sorek is new in chat. What are you doing? :)
a new scythe?
do i have a fancy name?
Can I bug her with mergers or bugs?
what sort of name do you want zlateski?
nkem, do you want to be muted? I don't care what day it is :)
errr, who's trying to get me in trouble with a fellow mod?
But seriously, so many yellow people online... You are up to something special, right?
wundertool?
still trouble with the preloading stuff? :(
oh yeah how has prefetching been lately? ok?
did everyone else just get booted from chat too?
You pulled the plug, eh?
firefox, what are you dooooinnggg
?
which means? players on firefix can't play?
ahhh. so it is jsut me, but not my connection. its my browser?
hm, just tried firefox, but it seems to work for me?
and chat was randomly on or off when I started up a session
prefetching and all?
what version nkem?
I get 403 errors when trying to load cached data
Maybe we have a different opinion on "slow" - I can see a checkerboard when switching slices for 0.5 seconds or so :D
@ every slice though?
chrome doesn't do that for you does it nkem?
@ccabj I don't know what you're saying
It's a bummer- I was sort of excited to see what score I'd get, but ended up getting like 20 points or something because I had to end early
Is that a limit of how many VBOs you can  have?
actually this is probably one of the few places where using javascript hurts us
You are like a pioneer that finds all bugs/problems with JS and WebGL so I can try to avoid them later. Isn't that great? :D
is there any way to see the rest of the cube, like the animation when you start a new cube?
@tiftik, does that help?
is this why we havw a new version?
i really like how synapses look like elephant trunks
shouldn't you be recovering?
from?
eyewire a thon?
is there an april fools joke?
hey, can you translate some bulgarian for us?
for the 3d model being backwards and upsidedown?
rprentki, why are there sometimes pieces in a cell overview that aren't attached to anything? different seed?
so what we do is give you guys 5-8 seeds at a time
we just want the branch until it hits the cell body--that's why we freeze them one you guys find them
only "Merger Report" ?
which one? 
the long green one that dips down? 
rprentki, you still here?
see? SEE? :D
that somehow reminds me of this guy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il-X-7d0pW4

no cell body in SAC? I just did one...
where is the id? :)
let you join what?

green line?
No, it is telling me about progress?
will they use it for cube attribution?
was I relegated to the beginning?
are you in the tutorial gisela?
Gisela, is it the first time you work on the challenge since it is public again? 
you're in the sac as weel aren't you?7
did you loose all your points though?
I did learn a few new things when I did it again...
why follow the weather forecast when the weather doesnt follow it :)
where are you gisela again?
which means how nay more points?
a5h - how many more for you?
How does one trailblaze a cube?
Well, yes, I gathered that.  But how does one get the opportunity to trailblaze a cube?
/?
it would sacn the questions in the chat?
sarabc, what you mean with "sacn"? :D
did you try to turn off the sound?
Is this still the case?
cube id?
I think I found how to regain cube you were doing before page crashed
I'm off for a while, the kids could be 20 how overstimulated I am
yes?
then when clicking start it should return you to the cube before crash
did you try clear cache? (maybe stupid worth a try)
(Thats where you should say: "nkem summoned me!", rprentki :P)
what if we have to fully map all the cell bodies we discovered later :D

the initial tutorial practice or the SAC challenge one?
hey ketta...how do get the cube number?
where do you type it?
what's up! check this out http://infogr.am/EyeWire-556496463
wait...WHAT?
you should hear when Americans and Canadians come online
or when the rest of europe wakes up
why can people earn more than 100 points? 
20pts corner?
What does trailblazing mean?
what's cb ?
maybe a special bot color?
when th chat is full there are at least 3-5 people explaining stuff
no idea what it should do?
Ok, I think I know what the error was
what should it do`?
should i test it too?
any new complaints, etc?
nkem, tell me about cell bodies?
cell body?
how do you trigger it :P
that's how I cheated in a former online game :D
hm... echo... could it be that eyewire transfers 4GB of data in 4 hours?
let me see how many cubes you did
you're on the overview?
I'll have to look, it's possible depending on how often the meshes are changed
ah, daysaving time... it starts in 5 minutes? :D
Obama is live now, are yall watching this?
Did anyone else just watch Obama's presentation of the Brain Initiative?
i've only been doing SAC for a couple days. Is that why I am getting all these large, gnarly segments? not the usual long slender fingers...
@nkem why do you change your name colour?
/msg echo Umm... is there somewhere a legend what different colors mean?
why? :D
but how does that happen?
two nkems?
/msg nkem so at the bottom, you never see a button that says 'inspect' right?
/msg nkem ohh so you do see it, but you can't hit it?
/msg echo that easy?
/msg echo but you really should explain somewehere what those colors mean
rprentki, was that the correct position?
rprentki, good day. Did you find out why I had to do the tutorial again?
you said you got through them again though, yes?
cool!  what did you learn?
is that being helpful?
you didn't get the merger not before?  everyone who went through the turtorial got the same stuff about mergers
sure? I am pretty sure, the really first day there were some popups missing...
/msg nkem pop ups missing eh?
nkem, you gave me a cube number along with the coordinates as well, how'd you get that?
see? SEE? :D
are they actually in chat?
it's probably that bug where you have to refresh
When I see structures that connect to the cube I'm working in, how come I don't get points for continuing those structures through the...
cube even though they aren't part of the "original" task?
Only occurs for me when trying to log in "manually"
How many times is a cube structure verified before it's considered correct?
depends on how well the confidence is :)
what determines confidence?
How good your result fits to the results of other players
maybe that's the cause for your confusion??
which cube?
I don't know how to look at cube IDs but I have seen the gnarly patterns at least since last night...I had one that looked like Medusa.
is that what @crazy cube looked like?
anyone want to chat?
Q&A? oh is eyewire there?
I not in American politics. what are you talking about?
again in one of these broccoli cells - you never know what to choose
gisela you having trouble?
anyone have a question for the NIH director about the brain innitaitve?
Ask them why they are not already playing eyewire :-P
any other q's? 
I'd hate to ask without reading further into it - where are you tweeting from?
I asked how Eyewire would help.
How do they think this project will impact the initiative?
Very cool! I'd love to know how much would be dedicated to bolstering existing clinical trials vs. new academic studies
Do you know if you have any colleagues at Lahey in Burlington involved with your team?
0.3I just started the game, how are you  supposed to get paid lol
jared, where did you read that you get paid? I am still looking for the link
Someone told me that you get paid? I am confused now haha
alright, any more questions about the BRAIN initiative?
I asked how it will engage the general public -- they didn't answer
If there were several ? from here it may have fired a neuron and he will find out more about Eyewire. 
hey ketta you online?
rprentki still here?
but I can't really tell, where they meet
what did you say before but I can't really tell?  i got kicked off chat again
sure - can I rotate my cube? or does this also change your orientation?
ok, I guess nothing happend? Great :)
yeah, that's what I think too, I was trying to make sure
see in the 3D how there are holes in it?
that can happen where there are synapses
holes? black points? vesicles?
it's when one neuron wraps around the other
Are those also called autapses?
no, an autapase is when the cell forms a loop with a little branch and touches itself
do you ever see two little nubs that come out and sort of wrap around and touch each other?  like they're hugging?
Who doesn't like dinosaurs? Like ninjas...
btw sent you/grim an email last night, not sure how legit my thoughts were on it
should you be ghostly?
ketta?
me or nkem?
why not both? :D
ghosty is cool...I wonder if they can do ghosty purple?
why were you nkemtest?
Hey, ketta - what is trailblazing?
any others?
I don't know what I have to do ? help :(
Isn't there a video or something? To help me ?
it should be less when I help
I guess I should speak up more when that happens to me :P
and losing points when you (and others) created a merger?
Are you also adding missing paths? That happens way more often...
I was fairly wiped out last night when I sent that email btw...so if I'm wrong, I totally understand (saw as I was getting ready to log)
/msg rprentki echo knows about that - actually he explained to me how I did that (accidently)
/msg nkem hey, rprentki here--how were you getting the cube number from this?
/msg nkem what do you mean you tried?  oh you can search cube IDs on here? interesting
/msg ticktock You see the "Jump" button?
/msg nkem yes this is interesting, did you tell echo about this bug?
/msg ticktock yes, he was in chat. And told me how to reproduce this :D
/msg nkem well i suppose you can use the jump cube if someone is working on a cube and unsure of whether what they're working on is right 
?debug
GUYS! Check out Obama's announcement about the BRAIN initiative - Sebastian was IN the White House when this announcement was made!! 
hey people! any brand new eyewirers here because of obama's BRAIN Initiative?
want me to take a look crazyman?
also why 4865?
@crazyman you there? 
okay thanks. I will email now. I seem to be a bit special when it comes to this chat.
hey! would you be interested in doing a mini gamer-profile? we're curious about what makes you so baller ;) 
mini gamer profile?
hey crazyman, can you take a screenshot?  eyewire keeps crashing when I try to watch
still figuring out exactly what form it would take
Would someone be able to confirm my cube? It's the first cube i've taken on with very little AI start
ok no worries, we can design it! would it be ok to get in touch with you by email to discuss? 
it's really uneven and looks like another branch might join, right?
I can't even see where the other branch is
what's the cube number?
@claire what was the email again?
sorry eyewire died again, try what?
does that help?
why did it work this time?
making use of that bug eh nkem?
ok want some assistance?
should I submit now?
man, if you'd gotten some more of those on sunday it would have been a short day to get 110000 eh?
yeah?
challenge?
what time?
that work for you?
challenge on speed, eh?
"Homer: Do you want the job done right or do you want it done fast?
Marge: Well, like all Americans... fast!"
i dont understand how to do this what so ever
some specific part were you get stuck? :)
you ready to go toe to toe with crazyman again to win?
?
hm, that looks like a new merger on SAC, eh?
where abouts?  I see a cell body forming
@amy aren't I supposed to lose the pink now? (not longer top daily all time)
laurenmcisaac, you get along?
we are heading to a new cell body?
what happened to the cells in the list?
what list?
only J cells and SAC is left?
he is the one who puts up new cells and what not
cricket?
Yea when the chat gets quiet crickets appear :P
you plan to fill a jar with crickets?
a new type or just a new cell?
but it's not, it connects to one of the J cells you guys traced and we want to see what it is
ohh so an unknown?
how soon?
it'll be up when you guys finish j7
will it be considered a level 2 cell?
how many hours a day do you eyewire?
me?
depends on how much I play battlefield 3
how so?
What's to deter a contestant from going hog wild and messing it all up
As in account deletion?
who wants to explain the Reaper?
Some poor undergrad TA shows up in a costume?
Is j7 near completion? (like very close?)
how do you summon the reaper?
is it too late to escape the GR?
Sup ?
rprentki you here?
this one?
send a email to support maybe?
Why Thank you? You owe me some money for pretending to be glad that you're back!
oh, that is the second cube in a row where I get less points than expected... :/
or should i say... my connectome? *dumdumdum*
jealous?
And then I will record answers and when I ask it a question it can answer! I WILL NEVER BE ALONE AGAIN!
They are not any fun anymore they have made too safe. Nets and covering up the holes between the spring. If you can't break what good is it.
Wut?
Any hot girls in here who like drinking german beer?
you drink beer for food?
Of course I do?
How could you know that? Are you german? D:
Where are you from?
There is a reason why we can't talk real german.
I wonder where lobusparietalis is from. His name sounds scientific... I fear it could be my professor...
and therefore you are always drunk? :D
in the brain, you know?
yeah, i googled it - that's why I know it's scientific :D
What? Yeah! We drink always.
that sounds fun! I'll even be home, so why the heck not? :D
Can the rest of us do cubes or will crazy and a5hm0r use all the bandwidth to the servers?
lobus, do you live here?
in Germany? Yes, Aachen
Wo liegt Aachen?
and then didn't elaborate...what was that about?
you didn't watch his speech?
@ketta obamabomb?
They will fix your brain when the BRAIN Initiative is finished.
Good summary?
thats insane... no idea how you do that

CrazyMan challenge is live! http://blog.eyewire.org/announcing-the-crazyman-challenge/



EyeWire is quitea technological feat
well... eyewire is the beneficiary!
eyewire is my insomnias new best friend hahaha
re procrastination, eyewire is making my research suffer!
My sister a M.D. says Eyewire is a waste of time because there too many neurons to map
My sisters thinks Eyewire is a waste like i told you all before and one sister a M.D.  I disagree with them
i think eyewire is working on adding accuracy stats
eyewire is only concerned about the edges of cell bodies
Eyewire is so educational. Improving english, computer graphics, neuroscience, and web development.
I still try to advance with my projects, too... Eyewire is not a big help in this regard :D
EyeWire is being presented for support and funding to expand our reach this morning at Biovision, the World Life Sciences forum. 
alas eyewire is not tablet compatable
but both are fun, and eyewire is easier
eyewire is always here to help you properly get work done
EyeWire is the greatest mission ever!!!



I think my accuracy has suffered because I don't fill in the bits not req'd for 'structure'
I think I'll reach my goal, especially w/ all this great competition...500k by the time games are done
I think so reb
and I think my cat is messing with my cubes now...holy crap
@echo, I think akio is describing the 'ghost' projections someone got a screenshot of yesterday (perhaps prior concensus?)
Maybe. I think I'm gonna take a break soon.
I think a picture of a cat might be more effective than a pic of a hot gf :)
I think I am on TeamX actually
I think it might've been blackout
which I think would be a great thing to do someday
i think he's exaggerating a bit on that, but...some american exhibit a special kind of stupid. Our education system is failing big time
i think they're big enough to want to command the area :P
I won two geography bees in elementary and middle school so I think I don't count in that
I think each slice is 10-20 nm and there is 256 in each cube
micrometers i think
qubit is FB reb, and I think from amy said, sounds like she fixed it
it's on echo's long to do list I think
@awallis not currently. But I think if you start playing and don't click in chat it stops showing up?
yes @iamby that has been on echo's list for a while now i think
that's what the scientists really said.. and someone (maybe media) shortened it I think
@coolcat cool -- I think this is on our wish list :)
and Ketta, I think, was right when she said it could happen to anybody.. But your can minimize risk by finishing the tutorial 
I got a message saying to pick another cell because I've done all the cubes on that one. But in the overview, I think there are more cubes..
yep, I think it ends Tuesday night...not 100i think there have been others...but it's true, you're a rare one hrss :)
not really well, i think
I think I screwed mine up royally.
I think green is FB
I think it does FB by default
I think i'll go in reddit team, Because I love the TIL's :)
I think the colors are: FB=blue, Reddit=red, Twitter=cyan, G+=gold, Team X=purple
I think this sould be forever
If you are mapping slices of someone's brain I think it is way to late to meet them, sadly.
After you do really well i think. and I know becuase I  just left it when I thought i did a while ago
I think the way it works is this: first it calculates the thing and give you the blue parts, you fill in the things you believe are correct
I think we are crossing references with one another. That avoids trolling.
I think mapping neurons is an amazing thing to be spending your time doing
@jcorbin click play and i think it should just throw you right into the tutorial
synlapses- My parents are both mathematicians. I think they would have cried if I hadn't gone into one of the STEM fields
Aristotle. I think the Greeks would bwe fascinated by our society
I think that's just different pictures durandal
agreed. thats why i think they would say wow......all this time and this is all that you've done
@snickle you can turn sound of in the bottom right I think
does anyone else admire the romans? i think they set an example
and as far as news media, i think Up with Chris Hayes if my favorite show
I think it's best to get one's news from a variety of sources.  None of them are totally objective.  And I think it is intellectually ...
I wish I was mapping for real too.  I think I am going to log out and get back on, on my "ancient" iMac.  It has a 24" screen ...
... and I think I might do better with this on a bigger screen, I can't seem to see or find the little bits.
haha i think typical americans are stupid too. im american living in ohio ;)
I think I prefer American women though...
i think i just hit a starburst neuron. for realsies
i think your answers get compared with other people so someone cant come in an screw it up
I think its a dud
I think it's randomised Pandemonium, it depends on your intellect
@ketta, I think facebook has a huge merge issue
reddit had a really bad one and they lost hundreds of cubes, but the FB one they're not sure about (i think)
Ba1r0g, I think that you may be right with that picture on the forum
miklanios, im getting the same type of cubes as you, i think.
haha i just fell asleep at the computer so i think it is time for bed. ciao and happy mapping! see yall tomorrow! 
andrewb I think
he beat me by a few hundred i think
few hundred..i think?
i think within less than 1000 points... he had 26k
yeah, for now I think I need my training wheels :)
sometimes i think their microscrope doesnt get enough quality in some slices
if it still says "check my work" then you must still be on a tutorial i think?
one of the labs at MIT I think
oh boy, i think facebook definitely has a merger happening
I think Yoda said that once too
I think this constantly
I think I'm a little too high now
i think the teams are just to encourage competition
red is for reddit, blue is facebook, i think gold is google maybe? or veterans?
i missed something i think
i think it's something to do with a laggy server
oh wow, i think i've got a cell body here
yes; I think x shapes are a no-no
i think i'm not getting many points for this one either
3 I think
@pezito i think my internet was freaking out last time
i think IFLS mentioned this a few months ago too, when Eyewire wasn't competitive yet
I am not sure. I think the latter. 
i think it considers a 3d 
i think I now got what u whwre saying
Anyway, I think what restricts us is the bandwith of their servers and their proccessing power
why is something "incorrect" when i think it is not
ok, remember the part in tutorial that said th AI does mistakes? should I just finish the cube when I think thats the case ?
I think the cubes are random 
a competition to see which platform does the most I think
I think he means the teams
I think I need to stop playing this before I mess up the results too much 
we don't have that in real time, but I think Amy has those stats
the AI should give some feedback I think 
Actually that's not true. I think the current AI has been trained all by lab members.
yeah, I think he's a swede
I think I'll wait until Spring Break. Maybe aim for 40k then:p
i think IFLS sent most of us here
I think they were saying the numbers will be a lil wrong for a few more hours
Haha I think it's been going pretty well:)
I think that's it
i think that was my highest score so far
we might have more neurons, but i think their size isn't all that different
Something to do with genetics I think..
ah..can't make that (and I think that's reb you're thinking of)
i think they're folds in the slices
i think the 9 yr old is gonna win
i think it depend on where you live, im 17 but i dont live in the states so my generation doesn't suck that much
I think it's kinda obvious that every generation sucks and doesn't suck at all at the same time... (19)
yeah I think he missed the mute button
I think something similar happened in Virginia
I think it's a made up word, but it's supposed to be the opposite of phallic.
I think there are 18 of them
I just refreshed again. I think it's behaving. . .
I think it stopped
can you go back and re do the tutorial? I keep getting low scores and I think it may be because I'm messing up or something.
i think they do it just 20 minutes behind the guys sex drive
i think i'm fourth right now
oh no i think u passed me
that constant trailblazing for points really screws up the cell (i think) and screws people who come after (on the bigger ones)
ugh, i hate doing what i think is good then getting 20points
I think there are a few starburst branches but mostly other cell types (I don't know what they are)
I think i am reddit team
i think i only saw blue/green on easter
I think that might've been one I TB'd earlier
anytime.... I think science needs cheerleaders lol
I think my keyboard needs a cleaning :/
I think I trailblazed that cube off a cliff
alright I gotta get to lab -- I'll be back on in a little bit yall! I posted a new leaderboard to FB - @viper I think you saw it :) 
i think so
not sure. could be lag. I think the system is under a great amout of usage stress at the moment, hence the probs with cube count per team
I think it is so cool that without knowing german, an english speaker can sort of understand what is being said
gunedown really? i think german is a very diffucult language :D
Technically I think it could haha
I think you should be able to
i think that was my first trailblaze for the day
once we create a program that will drive itself to learn by itself for itself, that I think will be the turning point
I think the only thing is... what would a senient network even want?
i think you cannot have a plan because noone can know what happens if we create a selfaware program
i think we will
I think that is happening in several places
I think in Chicago is one place
when i can't sleep i think of the immensely small scale of things inside us
it's over a year old I think
I think its genius that they are using so many people to help with the work. Train you quick and make it fun!! 
@mind-less since just after they went 'live' to the masses I think
I think he's been playing all night!
today or yesterday, i think
at least I think so...
she is on here right now i think
'other' work, but I'm at 327k so I think i'll make 333k
haha, like most guys i think, i don't particularly care for small dogs, but a teeny tiny dog? that would be kinda cool
i think team x has a smaller no. of high players, especially vs FB. and we've recently been trimmed 
yeah I think the trailblazing is all over the place.. sometime good and sometimes way wrong
yeah... I think TB should be a task for only experienced users
yeah I think it's unfair for new users
I think you are beautiful ketta
although I think it is the original version of the tale...
yah i think you are right about that
wait I think I declared that
my friends did the tiger... I think they'll win the Oscar for it :)
Yea, I can't wait to see the visuals of how the cells are connected. I think Jinseop and crew will start working on that tomorrow and have
Yea @Ketta! Is it in the Forum? I think I've seen it if it is -- perfect J indeed
I think I posted that before though
Ok I think I did that right.
Last time it happened I think I wrote something like 1000 lines of code in one night
hehe... I think the ones they had when I started were very different to the ones now
Ok. That was the one issue that caught my eye. I think they are all really good ideas.
oh, that's bad I think
I think it is due to the fact that when you say your finished, it always gives you another
I think it was Stalin
seriously... I think, echo and balkamm try to mock me...
and yes I think fb is still leading not sure
yeah I think so... not exactly sure what You may submit it and get only 20 points. I think it was echo who said they are a waste of time
I think it's because it's a contest. Usually they are not split like that
I think if someone on that team gets the same cube they will get the points
I think I'll try to do retroactive scoring now
don't know if anyone mentioned the same but i think the twitter neuron looks much more like extracellular space than a neuron..
Yup, almost my one year anniversary I think
and I think smalljude is still the most accurate?
I think it would improve accuracy somewhat also
well, I think there's a fair number of us here for the long haul :)
jaimie and I and I think a couple of others were running out a lot until we spoke up more
hm, I know you are working on completely different stuff... But I think you said we should poke you whenever we got something weird.
I think echo is afraid of personal frustrations being released on him in real life if people would recognize him.
I think maybe so :)
I think so...
I think, I got the same one before...
ohh I think I know where that bug is coming from
I think I mentioned it before, amount of times needed to click would be a better point system.
I think, counting the colored partitions is more likely
so I think what you have looks ok, but needs filled in more
I think
If you want I think, but theyre not nearly as important as mapping the general shape of the cells and the connections
suffice to say I think anything with neuro in it is pretty cool :)
I think neuroscience is the broader view. Basically anything involving the brain. Neurology is more the structure and function.
Trailblazing... I think :D
not sure I think the mesh server crashed again
lol k. I think I've seen something similar on all the cells they posted pictures of
it is :) I think it's great
Echo is here I think --
someones cooking.burning something I think in the kitchen 
I think it's just really slow
OK nkem, i think that piece just ends
I think, it's the one from Mythbusters...
ugh, sorry guys, i think traffic is picking up with the end in site
I think it's pretty awesome they c aught up...team x folks are not to be trifled with :D
jlovin i think i got the same one as you :P
I think I might have a cell body too, can you check for me Amy?
whoa, I had an innocent looking flat slice of neuron that exploded into what I think you guys are referring to as a cell body...
i beat my all time high score and 1.7k away from 500k total points..i think i'll meet my goal
I think the limiting factor would be whether it appears we're trying to make money or share science
and @Amy yeah...I think those would be great. There's only so much talking I can do before people start backing away :D
I think this is a merger
I think I'll just skip this one for now -_-
Oops I think I messd up that cube
man, i think a lot of team x left
you will probably be done near the time you pass 350 points i think
Just changed it to open -- I think you still have to request to join but welcome! 
I think so viper
it's the J-cell we're naming I think
Now I'm going to go dance a bit I think 
I think I see it
umm... I think it *might* be possible that I got the same cube again...
I think, we'll make a feedback thread in the forum...
fixed that obnoxious 'skip cube' bug I think
the lyrics are depressing. I think I love the bass player
you mean cache, i think :)
it happens in both Chrome and firefox. I think i need to listen to some offline moosic
but i'm not sure because this is still going slowly... >.< I think it's a sign to stop for the night
you can still change, i think...
yeah i think we got the many BSE cases in 2001-2006 here since then i never saw Brain on the Menu again^^
lol I think they're all sleeping for the next week
I think it's also the fastest we've grown a single cell
going to add a progress bar I think
but rarely now (a couple of times last night, but I think that's it since games ended)
heh..somebody here, lambykins I think, says it makes his laptop nuts
I think J-cell 3 is where they want us to focus
I think not!
haha @reb I think so!
I think he enjoyed himself :)
I think I did this cube before. . 
i am working on it right now i think
oooh i think maybe I see what you mean
@ezkleber, the biggest problem I think eyewire has had is people missing branches, but I'm not sure how to answer
yah, i think thats a good way of describing it
i think somethink is broke^^
i think there were 4 of them
I think that's kind of a good thing...his books are a really good balance of action, drama, and fantasy
I agree, Tyrion looks a lot better than they describe him... but Peter Dinklage does one of the best jobs on there i think
will have to refresh to see it I think
I just finished the tutorial, I think starburst are definitely the most challenging so far
I think that's an indicator that we are getting close to finishish
Its the one being explored haha I think its the only one not completed
I think this was the only new one after the competition.
i think only reddit team x and facebook finished
i think we have got a big merger
Hmm .. I think there is one big merge error entangled to the right.
I think any college it's hard to get away from people lol
Haha I grew up in a Sourthern California desert so I think that's why I love sun lol
hehe yeah, I think he must have randomized it more or something
I think I am. I need to take a long break after midnight
I think IFLS crashed it after posting a link to the announcement of the first neuron we mapped being named after them.
you get 20 points i think
Well, I think I'm off to some other kind of entertainment for now :) cya guys
I think so
Yeah I think I got top score locked up:p
nuts, I think I see a merge error
oh, I think there's at least 2 in the cell overview, I assume they're not reaping til monday
and I think amy leaves this week for the TED thing
I think since December
I think so :)
i think the heavy blacker densities might be synapses
they're 'potential' errors, simply a way of marking them to look at later I think
I think you're showing us all today. You might break my record haha
40,054 I think
it blew it up I think :)
I think I need to send the lab a nice box of homemade jam or something :P Everybody loves jam, right?
I think.
I think they ignore it most of the time...or it could have just stopped for them (it stops working periodically, have to refresh)
I figured, I'd said mine too but I think chat pooped out right after
I think we actually know what's wrong
@ketta that and I think one of the best things at TED is that you are around very diversely minded people 
he's out of town now I think
widespread I think. Theres a post on the forum
haha.. we have something like 4 sheep for every one person I think
but I think the AI gives them some clue, it must...I'd imagine
so I think there is some 'iffy-ness' to them at times...just a guess
pretty good I think, tried a new study tactic and I believe it's paid off
Honestly, sometimes I think...why hasn't it been done more already? Social networking has been around for years, so it seems natural
but w/ this project and other ones like foldit, I think there will be a lot more soon
I think I aced two midterms today, I'm ready :D
I think the pleasure is all ours!
i think the paper is going to be a big deal
haha... I think we *all* assume everyone is male here.  Such nice surprises :)
I think so
I think it's a pretty even ratio Sebastian
sorta..but I think it's more like a lot of them had previous obligations
been trailblazing a lot last couple of days but rarely getting retro points, but I think it's because no one else is working in the same
I think my eyes would give out way before 40K
i think my IQ will keep me in the tutorial.lol
i think my son will be better at this.happy hunting people..
I think I'll hang in there
each voxel is something like 20nm x 20nm x 40 nm, I think?
I think that trailblaizing is finishing the cube really quickly
The Shift key helps a lot, I think
for 12 of them (I think?) we don't give you any feedback during
I think it said you are done with the tutorial
I think we could really accelerate progress.
in the future, if all goes well, I think they plan to use it to map the human brain.
i think in the tutorial you can start over at the end of the cube or refresh the page
i think it depends on how accurate you work, how much you had to work and how many people did the cube before but not sure
I think this might be a record for simultaneous # of users online
I think, it is pretty neat :)
the backbone and the server are not i think somebody told us once
I still on the tutorial....I think
so i think i suck at this 
i think the amount of "finds" has something to do with score
hasba8133 - I'm a neophyte but I think they are an incentive.
I think it's curbed
I think for the solid cubes they mostly want you to click around the borders, no?
I think it is just to make it seem like a game so people will continue.
anybody there i think i just refreshed it
do /silent I think.
ok - I think I am catching on to the point system.  Points are awarded for the amount of AI missed that you catch.  
Yeah - I think it verifies that in the tutorial
I think so
I think... :)
I'm out I think
@kshearer nope, in fact I think it autologs you in the first time you go there from here
I think, I also had this...
but I think I tried going to forum from here and it still said I was a stranger
yeah @bglosh...the last 3 I think, are point givers
oh boy, I think i hit the real thing!
I think i mapped it in the tutorial already jp
I think the wiki said it means you're the first person to complete it.
whoops. i meant glow. did you know the informant's code name for watergate was deepthroat? i think their bsing me
I think it's on echo's list :P
um, i think I just discovered a new neural electro magnetic connectivic tissue located in the subparalysis
Hmmm I'm having a problem I think, only half of the layer image will load below a certain altitude. Any suggestions?
Ah, well... I need a break anyways. I think, I'll just leave it open a while :)
That's good.  I have places where I think they go on, but I can't tell where.
it's 18 cubes at the moment I think
too little i think
I think marking less is better. . . less resulting mergers
/msg GrimReaper I can't find the exit point of my branch... They seem to end in a bigger blob, which is unlikely, I think.
40K+ I think
@psych yea I think the all-time highest daily score was ~41K
I think that's why it's a 'game' 
I think too many people
it was fine yesterday, but I think the server is lagging severely
I think it may have glitched, my points didn't change and it didn't say I got any points for it
I think the server is down.
you know of anyway to change our user name?  I think I just want to use my actual name
same, I haven't done it in a couple of years...I think they've changed it a bit
mice i think
mice i think
I think it's awesomeness-score
purely to make it a game i think
i think they're optical images of thin slices of retina tissue
ok ketta i think thats 1st place
I can't remember...I think it's been truly 'live' a few months, but they beta'd it for almost a year (i think)
@ethan1 at this time, I'm not sure...I know the feature was in (I think) but not sure if it still is.
I think the ultimate goal is to map and discover more neurons than those already known
I think I'm gonna come back later. server dumb today
i think it references other people
I think it's around a dozen including Seung
You will only make a mouse blind at this point, I think. A dead mouse
Yes, I think it looks perfect...and then only get a couple of points...after 40 minutes.  That's a bummer!
I think we'd better allow a few more billion years for that
I got 136 points for 100 percent, but others are getting more. I think it has to do with complexity and size of the neuron.
yes i think a lot of ppl just logged in maybe - got home from work east coast USA maybe
there is too much evidence that evolution exists..but i think we were originally brought here by a higher being, i dont see us evolving just
I think a bear wouldnt mind eating a puppy. just saying.
All Im saying is I think science is the language of God and things like this are a good way to understand what happened. I believe in both.
we would look ugly to alo of animals i think, 
lol i think the personal debate website is the next one down on the right and this might be the mapping neurons one instead..lol
I think they probably take many peoples' interpretations and average them out.
game's been live a few months, but it was in beta stage for quite a while before that I think
i dont get what people mean by "i think in pictures"
i mean like... i cant tell what i think in. ha! i just think. i guess i think in words. but at the same time i can see it through the words.
they visualize things. for example, I think "I like pie". a picture person would think of a picture of pie and attach a loving feeling.
oh no I think I got a starburst. This is going to take a while. :)
I think...
i think i'm passed that. not sure though...
YAY!!! I'm out of tutorial!! i think..
diagnosed? no, but I think I'm mildly OCD
but i think a lot of people are like that, doesn't make them clinically OCD
hey, i think i got part of a brain
I think I'd do well, not flawless, but well
pfff..I think you like it :)
I think part of it is the increase in press this is getting, so higher server loads
I think i am going to mention this site in my English paper.
dang its another game like eyewire but a different study i think]
I think you mean "germy"
i think. 
i think so
I think it is one chat
I don't know i think it's only one room.
I think I turned off chat. I wonder if there's a way to turn it back on again.
I think it is all just one eye.
I think this is awesome.
btw the debug thing shows up now (more like how you intended, I think)
As in, if I think an area should be included but unsure.  Would they rather have us include something wrong, or exclude something we should 
I think I'm too type A cause now I want a scoring guide.  haha.  
i think a "Natalia" might perform better
nice. i used to hate dubstep and now i'm addicted.. i think everything goes well with it :)
whoa lol biiig neuron... i think i'm coloring the outside
I think we're just adding accuracy right now
I think my neurons would be better served elsewhere, but thanks.
well last week i think it was much faster with 200 people
its getting better i think
Otherwise I suck at this a lot more than I think I do.
I think I've been dumped into the "let this guy just fact check the ones we're already sure about' slot for cubes
i think he is 2 years old also
270 i think
I think they are getting a rush of people or something
I think it's trying to catchup to all the linked peices
I think the problem with most people is boundries could be almost unoticible
check out sandy's week/month totals I think they are near the top
I think my cube is broken.
I think I read that somewhere
"the general outline is more important than the little bits of dust you're adding" is what I think it said
yeah i think i got a cell body
I think there's an option to redo the tutorial
i think i got a starburst, cool my first one
i think, 29
I think it depends on where you center the cursor
i think i did the cell body earlier this hour. Drove me insane!
I think so
I think I'm missing something important.
Sometimes I think it glitches to a cube you finished previously
i think i maybe have a AI-merger here
Asking about the "cube" i think invites thoroughness....
I think of ginger roots
sorry canca I think my question derailed yours
I think the most I've gotten was like 170ish
I think it's based on consistently getting a high amount.
i think i got a good one
I think, I still don't understand. You are sure, ALT+Drag on 2d slices doesn't help? :D
Hm, I think, the pause I took to answer was way too huge too say "yes, I fully understand" :D
But, I think, I got it...
The one i got now does seem easy xD I think there really is an algorythm like reb said
the cell body in the wrong place I think...
yeah I think I just exploited one of them
242 I think that's a record for me
I think it's random, april. Go to the Wiki Tab it's explained there!
I think, I found a new method of trolling :)
I think, I got it now :D
well then good luck i think :)
yeah...tried in the 70s I think
yeah way more simple i think
I haven't checked in a bit but I think we were down about 50 players today
But I think the picture-name association is another stuff...
@johny yeah but tooth stuff is usuuall 'dent-' something, I think
yeah...bufo, i think they're changing that a little bit
yes, i know...only echo etc can "unban" I think
yeah but i think he said he would hate us because he would have to restart a server
Part of me wonders why I keep getting cubes with not much to do... and then I think I'm missing something.
I think I finally got my cube back to normal orientation.
I like those numbers. I memorized them up to about 16 powers? I think.
Sometimes I think 20 points happens because there wasn't much to add.
I think I saw one spot that looked pretty clearly wrong in a tutorial too though. 
I think I maxed out at around 275 all day
yeah..but honestly, I think a fair number of people who stick around here DO get it, and they are just as fascinated :)
that's kind of what amy does I think, or what she's working toward
i think theres some issues in this thing that need to be fixed
i think most ppl here are new
I think that is the goal, the boxes fit together once they are all complete
i think i might have done something wrong
I think you must be
yes, reached it an Friday I think
thnx, i think i understand now ^ ^
i think imma retire early guys lol
also i think some of the developers are in here on occasion
I think so, that's what they tell me :) Sometimes Any or echo will mention who is tops in accuracy
yes!  my first cell body I think
i think the Ai gave me a blood vessel to color in
Yeah, I'm glad too.  I think I'm getting the hang out of it
but that was an olivetti programma 101 (I think)
I'm not 100I think I joined back in August 2012
but I think that's a priority, getting the game to run more smoothly under heavier loads
I think it's supposed to be mostly accuracy.  The closer you are to what others have done in that square the more points you get.
It depends on the size of the frond you get i think
Sometimes I think that, and other times I think it could be part of something else that needed tracing, so it might ultimately help anyway..
I think I'm going to...it's one of those really fragmented ones that takes forever to find all the little bits of.
I think 5.3 or something is the earliest
yeah, I think the turkish ? is more subtle
16 I think
just for breakdancing though, I think
I think
architect I think I know what he means...it's all there but the rest of him can't get it out
I think a lot of people are interested in science, but don't feel like they can really contribute if they don't have degrees.
I think I'd actually prefer that schedule
I think Echo was the one who mentioned it.
I think we'll just explain it
Ah, I think, this is a bad idea
@nkem i think that test is biased, echo just tested it on you and himself and team
@auraseer, depends on how accurate the people mapping were, if very accurate, only 3 I think
i think eyewire is working on adding accuracy stats
though I think it's a different yellow..
I think purple has extra power. You guys have more points than we do
i think i missed out on the meaty ones
I think (if I understand correctly) they're going to have those who do well on the test work those cubes
i think you have to pass the 'test' to have access to the cell
@acida hmm yes I think that is true..we havent' sorted out all the details actually
I really want to know if I'm as good as I think I am or just deluded on those cubes :P
that's tough, happy with where you're going? I'm not almost done, but will make it I think :)
now microbes can really smell bad, except pseudomonas aeroginosa (sp) which smells pleasantly like grapes when grown on blood agar I think
then go to darker blue the next day (and stay that way I think)
it starts with today's high score, and I think it's just the first place score
ironically, popular in US i think because looney toones reference wasn't interpreted :)
@godonnell I can't remember, but it's in microns I think
I think I might be bad at this .-.
leafiabarrett - I think you've encountered a cell body of a different cell
I think the 3D view broke for me
I think we're reconstructing the cells pretty quickly
I think I might be spending too much time here
I think seeing what you've got wrong on cubes that are completed would be a very useful feature
@nkem, i think echo listens to you a lot
nice sneaky! and you've been a leader much more than me I think
I think, all time leader is jamie
Oh nuggets, I think I borked it. *sigh*
I think I'm going to cry
I think, I'll wait for Rachel :)
/msg nkem yeah I think she leaves it open :)
i think my last tutorial cube just crashed
I think it would make everything load faster.
I think everybody
last week i think
ok, I think, te problem is on my side... anyone else have no 3d view?
/msg nkem I think I was only allowed on team echo to bug you :) I expect to lose my privileges any time
@gisela, wait a bit. I think echo is loading the tutorial/challenge req'd to do starburst
@ketta I think cube 2 is meant to show people what a merger looks like and how to trace around it. Trick cube!
which is a little confusing, I think
I don't know...I'm on the 5th cube I think
1 i think
OH I think I just figured it out
Yeah, but hence I think, I spent more time than usual on them.
I think the first part didn't give me all the cubes
@rprentki I think the tutorial skipped 4 in the first part
ok, sorry that I can't help you, echo :( I think, I catch some sleep... it's almost 4am, again...
and I think it then gives you the same cubes over and over again
I get that prompt, and I think I submit and nothing happens
honestly I think this may be because there are a bunch of people doing starburst cubes that weren't in cache
I think it has the same problem with the  box not appearing
Ok, but I think, that is a "good" error
I think I found another bug
I think I did those tutorials w/ amy watching as a pilot group, I never went through the long tutorial you have now... 
I think they are actually connected
well... I think it's balanced. I need more time and get double points
had a blood donation before... I think my brain is a bit undersupplied...
yeah, it did't work for me...I had already been on the cell though, i think. Does that matter?
probably just a name color to start, I think that's what amy/echo said
oh, crazy - I think I know, which cube you meant with "merger"
I think, it is...
ah, yes - I think, I found the right path!
and yeah nkem I do, and I think you're right (seen the same pattern)
claire was the craziest dancer, I think
i think that one day.. i'll make a speech on TED talks.. o.O' i always have this awkward feeling X'D
Same here .. I think the processing of the 3D models happens on a certain interval.
I think
if they do I think our progress for the day will be done
somthing's wrong with my cube, I think
I think I'll be going to sleep now
yeah, I think, you defended your leading position again
I've had my share of streaks...but I think you've got this one :)
hm, I think he said something...
you asked, what I think... but yeah :D
i think we've mapped 20 so far.  we need the rest
and we also need to finish all the J cell candidates...two more i think
ah :( as a kid, I read a lot, and I think that would have made me crazy
But the rest 95+ I think...
yeah...I think they all have to be 90 or better
Ooooooh, wait - I think, I get it:
I think their general goal is just find the cell that the synapses to the IFLS cell connect to.
I think, the dark blue color was team "oldtop"
I think so :)
I think they were talking about the synapses.
I think he was talking to wtc theking
I think you have to be really high ranking to trailblaze
sounds better in ditch, I think
90I'll confirm w/ a yellow person, but I think you're right
mainly, I think the general assumption just hasn't been overcome yet
but here it's about 50/50 (amy said the other day, I think)
I think smalljude and I were the only females back in the day
I think my husband dropped out of life for almost a year playing some MUD
Yeah, I think it changes randomly each time you load it.
I think it already looks cool! :) http://whathecode.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/time_line_push_labels.png?w=620&h=348
yeah..amy needs to look at it i think
around 44k I think
closing in on 6 months I think
i think we play too fast :(
I think this is a jinesop/rprentki thing anyway
me, crazyman, ash, and a few others I think
ok working on it, but I think Jinseop may still be asleep
I think the way I'd want it to work would be holding down a key
I think I need coffee..
as long as you don't put milk in your tea...you get antioxidants out of some kinds (black and others, i think)
i think sleeping is allowed--last email for jinseop last night was at 3:30
i think he gets to sleep in :p
 although now that I think of it, most of my degree program, their idea of 'party' was prefaced by 'LAN'
i think in the cook book it's buffalo heart?
the grease would be too much I think,
I think it's more a local speciality
if you saw it, you'd agre I think :)
26 or 27k+? I think
I think there is something fishy around my cube.  a merger?  #48376
anitram I think we're too fast
icon would be best I think
/msg rprentki Hi rprentki, I think I found a merger - one that the others already added to the cell. But I am not sure...
hm, I think, I make a screenshot again :)
yeah, I think the AI merged two
So, I think that trailblazing is a little funny in SAC... you get 100 instead of 50, but when you get your TB retro points...
just the chat server I think
oooo i think i got one a those big blobs 
dudey dudertons a guy i think
and I think I just found another one
Well .. I think there was going to be a 'review' feature in the feature.
it's very interesting...i think it's not a J cell actually
i think that's why nkem made the comparison to OSGC#3
I think, I read something like that
I think whoever decided to announce march madness teams today hates leprechauns.. 
I think around -30, my brain tries to block out traumatic events though, so I'm not sure :)
I think newly generated
yeah..I think you're right :)
I think it might be a little while before someone reaches 1 billion
android app would be cool - if you could play offline (this takes so much bandwidth I think) and upload or something when not mobile?
i'll half brag - I'm in the top 25 :D first time I think
@christie I think it's a rational system, just sometimes players aren't...we had to deal with a few 'gamers' during 
ok i think i see it..from the thickest branch on the second cell, follow it down and you should see it
I think I saw it
I think I should stop working on J 5 for now
sure, I think most ppl are online atm
yes, if you see a discinct merger I think you can type /debug and it will tell you what cube you're on
So, I think it would be more efficient to look in the overview and check if my current cube belongs to the original cell, or not
You could cross ref your normal cube with the overview, but again, I think most times this isn't an issue
So I'm working on a cube now where I think the AI has made a mistake what slould I be doing?
i think so, but i'm not 100That's really interesting. I think, the team mentioned something like 38If I think about it... is harper a girls name only? :D
i think that sums it up
yeah would be good but i think it has low priority since in most cases it doesn't get really bad
i think they all have a spider web quality to them
I think i did it
/msg ketta I'll get on it tonight. I think he's cute too :)
I think our stats report is a day off
I think so
I think the cubes are available, but you're not marked in computer as "trailblazer"
I think, yours was already off?
No further complaints? I think, I can my shoulder for that one :D
but I think the points and the chat makes it for me
If I think there's a merge error do I /debug? Then what?
ah, I think, that's what I meant. Is that one?
-20? I think
I think I just need to be Richard Feynman
kettas FAQ? I think you know that one
I think she's gone again..
I think, its "Organisation is the last refuge of a tired mind" in english
yeah, I think you two have both done all the cubes for the SAC cell at the moment
I had an issue earlier but I think it was just the computer I was using.
Hi rprentki - I am trying to find the exit point of my branch, but I think, it'll work :D
i think i might have dropped the soap
the leg going on the right is merger I think and the one going down is the neurone
ok, thanks, I'm not good at it tonight I think, I'll go into my programation class and design a ppt for my husband
I think that was the first post about it I saw "this is a cool site, but every time I link to it, I crash it" :)
I think I saw it on reddit somewhere.
Haha, I think it's more of a personal win!
i know i know my mom told me ... i think might have been my teacher don't mremeb,erb who
I think it ended just recently. 
afaik it won't be in beta all that long...just long enough to make sure their fixes are working (I think)
I5 I think
I think they just installed XP service pack 3 on some of the computers like last week.
hsseung, got time to coach me a little? I think I've got a merger here, and never know how much to leave in/cut out.
yes I think so
The beginning is from Anton�n Dvo?�k, I think
I think, a5hmor is more likely to get out of cubes :)
i think 'the munchies' can be applied to many situations :P
It wasn't about the autosynapses. I think it was to help with deciding when something is a synapse vs. an extension of the same dendrite. 
I've got 234. I think it's getting bigger instead of smaller!
k I think it's on the thin branch next to the bouton
I think I likes Susan best, but Mort was my favorite book :)
i know they talk fast too, but...I figured w/ your grasp on English (which I think is really good) you might get something out of it :P
Oh, ok, I think you mentioned that earlier, I just didn't absorb it. :)
it really would. I think it'd be neat to have a player stats page, too.
Refreshed everything will be easier, I think :D
have you seen 'he was a quiet man'? I think that's what it's called
No, but I think somebody mentioned it to me recently.
Hm, I think I had this once when I clicked really fast on "Start Playing" and "Return to overview" repeatedly...
I think it would be perfect
I think it's in the wording
I think there's 1 right now, waiting for more
44k+ I think
would be a good idea to have a couple of examples somewhere (i think rprentki intends to do just that)
Okay, thanks... I think I've been playing this too much since I'm starting to recognize the cubes...
I think so too
I think I mentioned earlier, would be nice if one gets a low score to be able to try again... would learn faster.
Still pretty impressive I think.
I think you mean obsession/compulsion
no, another heatmap. One in the overview. I think I caught an UI bug that gave me the Admin-view :D
i think the main focus is the difficult spawner :P
huh? no... I think, that was just coincidence
I think he's just trying to trick us
I think, in TV shows it's called Occam's razor :-P
Hm, echo is saying: "no!". I think, that means "no"
hey I think it actually works!
I haven't tried to rotate real life yet.. but I'm close I think
I think we got something wrong
I think the trailblaze points on SAC are not getting doubled
also I think we made a mistake on the SAC beta
I've been trying to figure out how to make the cell bodies appear -- i think it would improve the interface
I think it's like 10 synapses
yep! I think we're adding an easier to trace starburst cell
I think there should be an option to download all cube data at once
Hm, I think you didn't want to summon *me* :D
I think we're doing amazing today
both I think, but it is harder for the older
and you are saying could have cross branches?  like I think if I have a branch going east west and another going north south it is wrong
there's one more J cell I think
as is, i think
I think he has been playing 14 hours now, he is going for 20 hours 
i think so
I think adjusting the chat is on echo's list...he knows we don't like how it jumps :P
its been months i think, its makes sense
I think that won't work
one was the same as I had (the first I emailed you about i think)
I submitted,  dont know how to get 2nd opinion - got over 400 pts so I think it is ok
hmm I think it must have been
With the nickname, there come obligations, I think...
also I think there's memory leaks or something
ugh, I think i'm stuck... I just started a cube and I can't find any branches off the original 
That's the part I think might be wrong.
i think you can ignore it. the basic branch is OK
that one is really tough. but i think you did it right
but i think it's clear that pretty much anyone can improve by practicing
but actually it's challenging...i think people are still improving even after months
@hsseung, I found where you go for getting CME accreditation. http://www.accme.org Sent it the other night, but I think you had gone.
Definitely does. I did some clinicals in the prison, loved it, but I think the restrictions would make me crazy after a while.
Oh, I think I found the spot
aaah. even clicking on the 2d view should fix that, I think
I think it's a debug feature for echo :D
I think I did
i don't know, but i think they're after crazyman's record :P
I think other's points are considered.
Would get pretty hairy to code, I think. :)
I think we're headed towards another cell body
I know grey are areas that are locked/frozen (done w/ no more to add, I think)
oh yeah reb, that's what I think for black too
I think green is supposed to show where new cubes have generated
the cell body of J 5 I think
@ketta, I think that often...it's kinda creepy :D
I think, I found your "same cube twice"-bug...
i agree :) and I think you can beat the high score (happy thoughts for your happy internet)
I think you have to have a life to have children. ;)
I think they said like on Wed
I think he means getting that amount of points without finishing the tut.
I think the only correct assumptions to make here are a tendency for obsession/compulsion and competitiveness
74k I think
I think it would be a blast :)
I think, we found the "twice the same cube"-bug
he likes to be I think, but amy keeps posting photos of him!
green is from an ephemeral bug I think
I think they load more quickly, just takes getting used to the pixels resolving
I think cubes load slightly faster now
although ketta was talking about something else I think
amy I think you finally owe me a cup of coffee
/msg echo I think I have to wait some days. Already sent two mails this week...
ok I think I am going to go work on personal projects for a few hours
I think he means when he's scrolling up/down
not saying you have to...it's just that I do it so if I think it's going to be problematic, they can be aware
thanks! it was about 1000 pieces/ i think thats the point system? 1 point per piece? :)
i think I'm getting the hang of this!
for a quicker answer, I think Amy is your best bet
I think I found the plane opacity reset bug
not sure if this is the kind of input you're looking for. but i think it would be cool if the last piece you placed was a different color.
fixed cursor turning to text-select on paint (I think)
I missed something I think
I think you should put it on the forum
I think those were all, or?
i think echo's trying to beat his record of versions in 24 hours :)
I think, cursing helps to deal with physical pain...
I think we are having many issues, which is compounding my problems
eek don't even say that rinda, if you mean what I think you mean :P
seems to load faster I think, even though I try to play before it's al the way loaded.
I think it'll be really helpful 
I think so too... anticipating that for sure
i skip cubes when i think i am completely wrong and can't figure out a better way... but now i won't
*you got ?t I think :)
it should be public soon...within a couple of days I think, or less
i think they've been around a few weeks
I think she's got it today for sure
@rprentki yes..the D3 (i think it's D3) that's made in your skin is the problem
has to do w/ Ca conversion/absorption? I think
yeah, jaimie had 1 million a couple weeks ago or so, I think
I think so, unless there's a lurker
I have a bunch that look like tunnels... I think you are okay,,,
Intersected 5 sides of the cube before I finished. A couple of them more than once. I think that's a record for me. :)
hey, I think I took care of the merger you were talking about
/msg reb1618 I'll probs have to change it back, I didn't give you privs, I think, just the color
never taken a screen that way, but I think I understand.
ah I think I know what's going on
I think rinda was thinking of making a favicon with them
yeah I think so
I think, Ketta said she was from around there too
bleh..I think every parent does, and most parents have to deal w/ them eventually
yeah...it's the last j cell i think
ok I think I understand
so there are a few loops in this one, i think maybe you picked up something going through one of the loops
amy i think after you promote them they have to do it themselves
can't wait and I think it will make some of the tough cells easier to deal with
wunderstood I think!
nah, I think you both like stringing us along ;D
i think it's just chance that you got a bunch of small ones in a row
the only ones that show up in the chat are high scores (above 60 I think) so it can seem like everyone else is getting high scores
above 50 I think
I think I just passed all the Starburst practice stuff. Is there a way to find out? 
if no one is complaning i think we'r egood
so I think only one branch of the three belong
that's what I think too
I think I just got that cube again.. like 4 cubes later..
I think that means it's bedtime soon :)
based on accumulated last 4 month ( I think) scores
i think its easier a little to hold the shift and float through the slices then check for color every couple slices, 
I think another form of blue
I think with up/down buttons added it could be
I think it would use an enormous amount of data alotment if not on home network
I think we're nearing another cell body :D
I think I counted 6 
I think I found the correct one
Haha I think we have stose stats somewhere but I've never seen them
just wondering, that was a long time ago, eyewire games I think
umm, I think I'm only supposed to use team GR when I'm reporting a merger or to...give nkem a hard time :)
@nkem, ask rprentki, I think I surpassed you in merger reporting...you haven't been around much though ;D
i think your spelling better :)
/msg reb1618 No, not yet... But I think, I know it already :D
/msg rprentki I think I know how to send you the coordinates. Don't know why I ignored them till now... sry
Umm... sry if this sounds mean, but I think "58,000 people" sounds a bit euphemistic...
I think I just hit a merge. I am still in the cube. I pulled the /debug the Cube ID: 51118 Last seg: 4239. I will fig how to capture.
euhm 8 I think
If I think about it... maybe that's why I am not on team echo anymore :D
helped someone one day I think :)
and how do you change you color? someone(nkem I think) did it for me earlier
I think I just beat the highscore
alright I think my laptop is about to overheat from running eyewire, screencap and music ha 
she's the only reaper that's been around this weekend I think
Ah, ok - I think, that's enough :)
the logo thing that gets on the shorcuts, I think so
I think I get a lot of points after staff review. With all the 20 points I get don't think I would be close to 1k.
I think, the slice was cut too thin...
/msg amyleerobinson I tried to submit all those wrong cubes without adding something new... but I think, it didn't work :D
I think, you only need a tiny scythe...
I think she's amazed...I'm a little amazed myself at the 100k thing :P
I think jamie silenced us again :(
ooof, I think i may be going into sugar coma from easter candy
I think I'll finish up and then go meet my bed
i think that's would be a wise decision crazy
i'm great on cubes...i think. was gone for a day
I think the repear is back in it's lair now
they had one hit in the US i think :(
the us band was 'metal'-ish i think
yeah tiftik, but I need mo melody then they can provide I think
the cube numbers also have to do with their location in space i think
@rprentki, I think one more person needs to do it
hey ash, I think your pink might be permanent :D
I think you do, considering one team can't be two colors at once
@ash I'm not sure, I think amy has to do something
I think so!
I think we're headed towards cell body
I think I found how to regain cube you were doing before page crashed
"Hello, I think you might be on fire... literally"
I think, you are right *evil grin*
I've read there's some pretty weird stuff going on w/ copyright laws etc in some countries in Europe...but honestly I think some serious
it may take another decade or so, but I think copyright laws HAVE to change or half the population will be in 'jail' or fined
I think I just got started too quickly.  It is fine now. I whined for no reason. ;-)
same...pretty sure i had walking pneumonia in february, and am just now at the point where i think it's fully gone
I think, I need a flood protection
Ok, I think I know what the error was
but of course - I think, I'll stay here...
I think we all need to work together :)
I think we're headed to another cell body
ah well...I think they'll be back :)
yeah, that's what I think too, I was trying to make sure
ok i think we should forget about trying to make this one somooth, it's just ugly
I think I might have completely messed up the cube I'm doing
I think that might be the one nkem had earlier
/msg nkem so people like crazy, ketta, reb, etc yeah, but no one who isn't purple I think
I think I'm getting too used to double points :D
that's 19.00 I think
I think big brother is having a little fun
I think it will be close...and fun
25044, I think I'm done for today :o)! Good night!



325k today? I am flattered but do not have the time!
I think I am on TeamX actually
I have one that I am not sure about
i am just looking them up
i am always looking up at the sky now
that's why I am not a fan of trailblazing...I like keeping my accuracy up
I don't fully understand, I am afraid.  What am I actually doing, if the AI already has it figured out?
2 o'clock in the morning and i am conneting neurons :O
how i now if i am in totoral?
I want to meet the person I am mapping...
The chat is really distracting me from my important work!  I am about one millimeter from the end of my progress bar
and I can't seem to find the bits I am missing.  Frustrating
thanks Amy, i am always looking for more good sources of info
I wish I was mapping for real too.  I think I am going to log out and get back on, on my "ancient" iMac.  It has a 24" screen ...
I am too
I am distinctly lacking in a penis
I know, but I am easily distracted.  No will power, I'm a chatter box
I am so confused as to what I am doing right now 
I just don't get what I am accomplishing here 
I am
i am lagging big time, any of you?
I am not talking about you specifically with that question, miklanios
lol. damn.  I am not very good at this
I was just about to say I am going for IFLS
lo don't you know Jacob? it is Jeff Brdiges!...dont listen to me i am just crazy
and I am trying to go through it really quickly to get the best time
well I am now a very happy girl in blue now :)
Maybe I am just too tired, but this isn't working out so well for me. Everything is blurring.
I am not sure. I think the latter. 
how hot it is? I am too xO
@amy.  Yes and no.  eyewire says I am out of tasks, but if you look at the select task lists it says that team x has 0 cubes
hmm, I just skipped a cube and its brought up a pop up telling me I am the trailblazer, a bug possibly?
there is a job link at the bottom of the apge but I am a special case
Ha I am going to TEDActive then to yosemite and finally SF 
I am struggling today
haha yea I'm moving from team to team. I cant pick a team, I am EyeWire HQ!
I should stop this right away, I have the feeling I am the macular degeneration incarnated.
You guys are all way past me...could you explain to me what all of this filling in the gaps is? I am on the tutorial, you see.
I'm probably not the oldest, as I am only 30.
i am
i am using firefox
Now I am waiting for a yonic one...
AHAH I am from toulouse 
I keep getting almost nothing but trailblazers, is that because I am accurate that the algorithm wants me to be statistically relevant? 
I can pretty much tell when I am trailblazing from the 3d as I am entering the cube, and then find lots of differences.
i must say, i am really impressed with the AI, i mean, its obvious that humans are still needed for the mapping, but the AI is pretty damn g
I am pretty sure he just fixed it so you could use that feature the day before games started
I am so far into this the only thing I get are trailblazers...
i am having the same thing happen to me
I am not sure who Cad is
i am a n00b
I am on a mac and completely study at screen shots. I dont know how to take one.
i am just jealous, i have some serious chicken scratch handwriting
now i am in first
damn i am almost 1st place
okay i'm blaze chaining.. I am crashing
that is why I am dedicating all of today to eyewire
i don't really know why i am on reddit team
guys? any advice for a newbie... I am terrible at this *sigh*
I am asking because Grim said he could use his mute button if he "needs it"
I think i am reddit team
and I am slow lol
Yep, yes i am
haha glad I am behind a computer then
which is awesome because I am talking organic chem right now and that is a lot of spacial stuff
but I am bad
for all you know, I am actually the program becoming sentient, with a wonderful cover story
i am so shit at this -.-
I am passed the tutorials but still cant figure it out
yeah... well... I am not going to miss any funny chat comments ;)
which i actually thought was kind of amusing because then it looks like my screen name is trying to be "I am by Kins"
Hm, today I am experiencing a lot of missing slice chunks, 3d blocks and once even colored 2d parts... No one else got those?
I am a guy and I am the one saying it
when i see your face  -- :) -- i am like, awww
and I am so NOT a disney movie person
now that i hear you guys liked it so much i am kinda excited to
D: I am totally not
I am a big fan of this Harlem Shake idea
I am jelly
but I am resisting ;)
I am
I am doing completed
haha you guys I am so obnoxious to the team this week -- any time something pops up I immediately email "what's up, the cube counts are off!
@Jamie, just as I am catching up to you, you get another 400+ -.-
I am off for the nite - goodnight all - happy tracing
ok now I have to go to bed. 1,000 points today woot! #11..we'll see how low I am by the time 8 am rolls around ;p
I am ahead on credits so I could have graduated this past semester. But i don't really want to. I'd lose my mind sitting at home :)
grrr I am doing something definitely wrong getting only 30s O.o
it might be since I am terrible at tb
weird @ketta no I am not sure that we all know bout this -- could you guys send in reports and screenshots if you have them to support@eyewi
I am not responsible for your interpretations!
@amy I am here :)
I am out of cubes - only had 3 to do after not playing all day - ran out last night
ok,  and I have not available cubes since last night, just fyi - so I am doing completed
it's not the one I am suppose to do, I have one of the tiny one on the side
i'm not a lab member.. i am yellow, cuz i am a spouse of a lab member.. hehe.. they are going to change me.
next year I have to take my degree and I am kinda O.O
so (though i am trying to be accurate as possible) if i make mistakes it won't ruin my teammates lives? lol
I am waaay too slow to trailblaze...
but maybe I am the most accurate eyewirer ever :D :D
Ah, I am sure, echo will make this retroactive stuff working this evening :D
Again - I am too slow to trailblaze...
maybe your program assumes... i am an expert 8-)
I am not staying up for that
some cubes I can tell where I made a mistake, others i am clueless....
oh, but now I feel discriminated - I am never a trailblazer :(
I am grimreaper
Hahaha I just realized I am hitting the up and down keys at the same rate of the Dubstep I'm listing to.
I am going to silence for a little bit to see if I can get mine to load faster and to power trace
no, it's not great - it is 2:23 am and I am the trailblazing guy of TeamX today...
@nkem I am  here btu I cannot reap
I am going to be... epic 8-)
yeah, I am off, too. 03:30 am :D
danny!... I'm dying... the pressure is too much... I am unworthy
Ketta, I find that to be true for myself regardless of what I am trying to talk to people about
I am also rprentki
I am off too - goodnight
I guess I am off to sleep too, and if tonight is like others recently, I will be playing this game in my dreams alllll night long lol
thanks ketta, see you guys all tomorrow probably to talk about the results i am sure
sadly I am in chemistry/chemical engineering. we are pretty devoid of the female type
oh.. yeah i just discovered that i am not ....
i am almost afraid of messing it up
that is also why I am curious at my 8 straight hours os TBing
But I am really not sure
I am burning with curiosity!
@echo: I am not a fan of underscores in my name
DIO CAN YOU HEAR ME, I AM LOST AND ALL ALONE
the more intense and angry the metal gets the calmer I am :P
can't wait to freeze myself. And 1000 years later I am delivering parcels everywhere in the universe :D
I am tired :D
It's just 7:45 where I am
2:47pm where I am
Now I am officially intle... itel... smart
Ok, its 3am. And I am totally useless today :)
sorry I am tinkering with things
I am going to remove SSL from eyewire, at this point it's too much trouble
I am
i am working on it right now i think
Otherwise... ketta can mute me if I am talking too much :D
Oh, I am so glad that I never even saw one of those films...
Yah, i mean it's not ALL bad, but the epic battle scenes are more what i am disappointed about
Yah usually I am a fan of stuff HBO does
i am pretty happy with most all the main characters
not that I am aware of.
I am new here, so I don't know who is who :P
Year I am getting a bunch too
I am going pretty good, try to reload
I'll probably not play more than I am already playing. I've logged QUITE a lot of hours
I am Friberg.
sorry a question, I am new and am learning but i cont remember I like can play with the contrast??
Today I was reminded how glad I am not to live in Portland anymore. Wheeee!
I think I am. I need to take a long break after midnight
reb1618 you are 7th with 101372, I am 8th with 100363 :D
hm, right now again - but I am not sure, if it is a bug...
hm... for Firefox I am using Firebug ;)
Ketta said to skip them.. so I am 
and I sound a lot worse than I am (like Rod Stewart, LOL)
woah, I am on fire today :D
or was "im making a videocast!" a hint... like: "Hey, I am making a video - don't chat that much!"
I am still not sure how to help zlateskii...
ok... it seems I am done for today :)
now I am worried about this new test
Also I am afraid, the real problem is not eyewire...
This is fascinating but I am not sure how long it will capture my interest.  Any of you been here a long time?
i don't even know. I am coloring neurons
I am the GrimReaper of the game
i am quite sure to have a merger here. what do i have to do?
Ah, I am still not over it, yet...
I am 
I am
I am
I am
I am
I AM
I am wasting time before I have to go to a meeting, blech...
@GrimReaper, I am assuming you're associated with the project?
I am proud to be contributing to the progress of the human race (and pretty much any life form with a brain) 
I am literally one sliver away from completion
have to check it when i am on the other pc, the graphic card was ok
but i am using it rarely
Yeah thats why I am here
yes please I would like a hat, that was a bad joke by the way I am glad to help
I am in the second phase of the tutorial where my work is checked.
guys does this mean I can tell people I am a neurological analyst?
this is so slow loading.  I am trying to do another cell as this one simply quit working.  But the other cell won't load.
......I am WORKING
I am coloring my brain!
I am
I am not a nerd
i am having irc flashbacks
heard this on npr this morning and i am now addicted!
I am plodding through the most boring cube ever
this one that I am dong looks like a guy trying to kick himself in the face.
left is a cube with only a black and white picture in it, there is no color.  Also I am assuming the cube is supposed to keep a 3d image of 
I am past that.
you see? I am good at wishing good luck!
Oh yeah, hello everyone who is newer than I am.
I hope you all are doing better than I am. My cubes are going to be the outliers
Holy crap. I am in a cube. The place that I am filling in takes up over half the screen. helloooo, points!
not for the cube I am doing.
i am loading a bit slow.
oh. I am not sure then.
ok - I think I am catching on to the point system.  Points are awarded for the amount of AI missed that you catch.  
oh okay cool cuz i have a class i dont do anything and i play this game thinking i am helping but now im glad i am 
1 hour and 20 minutes since I started this cube. I am close to almost beginning to being done.
/msg echo hi I am approaching 1 million global pts - just want to make sure the score will go that high and don't want to advertise this
Darn, I just wanted to do one more cube and now I am stuck at this one :(
Oh, sry - is 'darn' a bad word? I am not sure...
yes i am
Its been 2.5 hours. I am going to kill myself if this cube doesnt stop having more things for me to fill in.
Well I am gonna go and get a shower. Read a book. Eat. See you all later.
I am looking at your words, Hockey.
actually I am :P
and I am pretty sure, there has to be an exit...
I AM NEW
i am finished with tutorial gonna go eat breakfast and give my eyes a break...later all
haha yes I am actually a robot. Siri is real and her name is Amy
mm maybe i am
man this one i am working on is a monster
i am
I am pretty sure someone forgot to press the B button.
i am hating these new cubes. I always get the ones that already look complete.
i am
I am learning that I suck at this game
I am
I am failing at this game...I am only getting around 5yea, that perfectionism/ocd thing go hand in hand...im so much like that at times when i am tense or under deadlines
It takes time to understand how to work everything, once you get the hang of it and you start to see the patterns I am sure you will get...
This game makes me feel like I am doing something rather productive 
Haha I am right here with you mailman!
yeah, well... It is 03:23am and I am just back from a birthday party. :)
ok now I am out!
I think i am going to mention this site in my English paper.
I mean, look at all the time I spend here...I'm just fine. I am. Truly.
I haven't played Foldit yet, but I am interested in it as well. 
I am on foldit for about 2 yrs now
i am in the tutorial takeing my time
so is what i am seeing a complete structure of what everyone has mapped so far?
but i am ok with it 
i am
this kind of reminds of internal sunshine for the spotless mind. every time i erase the red neuron i feel like i am deleting someones memo 
that depends on how good i am
i am single with hardly any social life :)
well now i do wonder if i am doing this right or not
and never has.  Because it's never been anything more than an indicator of where I am up and down in the cube
probably the largest so I am focusing on it first.
 i am new to this.can you explain what this dose
quite a few. I am on my last one.
I am still waiting for team echo...
Oh, zlateskii was here a while ago. He said: "I am going to do a videocast" or something like that... and that was the last thing I heard...
I am too stupid for the new feature :D
I am kind of confused
tutorial: seems like a lot of trial cubes - or perhaps i am just doing poorly
Yes, I am not at all interested in reading the boorish comments of the world's foolish people.
I am
I am 
i am
If I am trying to fill my cube quickly it asks me if I want to "kill pages"?
It looks like all the hay strands are mapped, except the one I am supposed to do? or?
@vevmx3 i am!
soo... i have finsihed the tutorial, now i am mapping presolved neurons?
I am, I reloaded the last time, but it messed up again
#68 now. I am so much science
No, I am not sure about the meaning of the word "pan" :D
I feel like I am doing this sooo wrong.
i am not thinking of an exploding posterior
where i am there's an error
I dont even know who I am talking to anymore.
:-( I am lucky to get 20 points at a time. I suck at this right now.
I am soooo slooow
I am at a loss with this cube...
I really have no idea. I am on JCell#4
i am jesus 
i am the massiah 
@troyboy4life I am probably overestimating, but maybe 0.000000001I am just trying to remember things about you all :D
I am slightly confused right now...
lots of old buildings where I am
I AM NOT LOUD! AAARGH!
Ok, I am off for now - watching a cool movie or something :)
yeah but that probably changes all the time so it would be a lot of work to code that (now i am asuming)
i meant when i am 'finished'
i am a newbie and am still figuring things out. 
i am thinking that all the time...too little...too much
And I am doing so :D
ok, I am off - this time for real, ketta :D
lies! I am not a liar!
Nothings wrong I am just curious how this is all organized
I am fascinated by the law of averages like if you get a bunch of people to guess how many jellybeans in a jar and take the average 
no I am saying congratulations for being a smart 14 yr old
yes sir i am
I am past the tutorial... and I can scroll down and see all the scores, but I am not listed where my current score supposedly would be
and also when i click "this week" or "this month" nothing happens... can this be a browser problem? (i am using chrome)
I am so smart
I have always been fascinated by biology so this makes me feel like I am contributing which only adds to the addictive nature of it.
...as I am fairly certain that some of my blobs are overly blobby. :)
I am awesome
Do it with a normal user account and I am speechless :D
11:57pm where I am (central time)
Now I am jealous
yeah, I am trying to be more... pink
And now I am admin?
Or I am just doing something different from time to time :D
yeah, and now I am stuck to this hello kitty pink
So, lets see, if I am normal, again
/msg echo I am really sorry, you know that? :(
Everyone will think, I am admin...
huh? I am not?
i am purple
just kidding, I am nice :)
I really want to know if I'm as good as I think I am or just deluded on those cubes :P
I am on it, right now
I am not a mod though
good - don't know how much I can play - I am moving in a few weeks and have chores
I am moving to California
Interesting - I am listed as a moderator on the blog
oh WOW and it saved my work! I am impressed.
true..but I am trying to complete my education too :P
Oh, what? I guess I am too. basically. The second starburst. Oh god, this dosn't look fun
no problems, I am a stalker too, for most blogs I follow
that is what I told a new college some hours ago - but I am just lazy
i am working on my tutorial 
I am not sure if I understand you, holly
i am working in the tutorial and im using both
Oh, the first time I watched the TED talk, I understood "I am more than my jeans" -.-
I am not wearing shorts :(
I am waiting for the app to take with me - I have to leave for teaching my students - computer stays home
though I am on test server, one sec
Soundcloud... I am missing the "3D" in the name. I need CGI :D. With fancy shaders :D
I am sure, it is because the servers have to convert my metric input to an imperial equivalent :-P
OK thanks for the tip. I am going to try
I am sure, he doesn't like me :D
I am preparing for the test. Haha
I am probably about to break the site
I guess, I am just lucky
I am used to a 3d view, and yes, if I refresh or skip it's still blank
ok, now I am confused...
But I am glad, that you are here, of course :-P
Normally not. But I am pretty sure, that it is only a bug with the user interface...
also @rachel the cube count at the bottom suring star challenge is inaccurate. It's said I am on 6 of 6 for 3 cubes now
I am on 3 of 6
ah, I am not the only one :)
You guys are better at EyeWire than I am!
I am just trying to confuse you a bit... so you will lose your time bonus... MUAHAHAHA!
also I am using Chrome
I am attempting to "skip cube" and see if that works
uh-oh. I am done with the initial tutorials now :(
With your "Ok, I am going to break the page now"-comment, if I remember correctly :D
I am pretty sure, yesterday I got one of those cubes without a progress bar - now with
I am pretty sure, one of those cubes I did yesterday without the progress bar
Ok, I am heading homewards
I am on the challenge: how will I get the next cube?
I am pretty sure, I got 6 cubes with progress bar yesteday...
I am at SAC input
just telling echo that something has changed. But I am not sure I really finished the practice
echo: can you see the cube I am on?
an I am a good tester
->Whatthecode, how did you get it to work, I am on SAC#1 but have no progress bar or feedback
when I go to play I am able to maop
Once I'm a SAC Hero, will it announce it  on chat how awesome I am? :)
I am.
I am
I am
oh wait... as long as the piece I am not sure about is not going to touch a cube border, it is rather irrelevant, right?
rprentki and jinseop are watching us again, I am sure :D
yay! grim had to come in because I made a merger...it only took 3 cubes. I am not allowed to play star cells 
But I am pretty sure about the correct path
I mean, yes, I am slow. But almost half your speed?
(I am guessing, of course)
like seriously you guys totally killed this harlem shake x'D @hsseung's entrance was LLOOOL xD haha  :D yes i am.. :)
I am the slow one in team Stargazers :D
No - not that I am aware of... But you can see that we are moving away from the former, visible path
I am interested in the theory as my daughter's retina doesn't work correctly
I have been playing for a week. I am hooked. I hope it gets better.
I am sure I did, too
I am doing it right now, significantly harder
I am sure, you can become purple if you want, laure :D
or I am blind
I am actually addicted to both
yep, I am a winter city dweller as well
no idea - you know, I am never out of cubes
no, I am not sure, what a UROP is :D
I mean... echo is a physicist and doing your programming stuff. And I am a computer scientist and drool about the stuff they did here :D
/msg rprentki Hi rprentki, I think I found a merger - one that the others already added to the cell. But I am not sure...
urgh.. I am confused with lower and upper here
yeah, I am sometimes slow at that kind of things
I am sure, you normally got something like 35.62 points
Ok, I am off as well. happy tracing!
I am
I am having a bout of insomnia. decided to play on a computer than lay in bed bored
i am thinking of changing the scoring system to reward ppl more for following a branch all the way across the cube
I am sure, you don't see the date, you joined?
here I am
Ok, I am off again. See you later
That's where I am.
and I am avoiding my programmation class
i am new 
i am 
i am leaving but i said hi too
Makes me think I am good, hah
I know right! I am trying to get a graphic design/animation firm at the lab
Hm... as long as it causes some confusion to the AI and therefore disabling the spawn of new cubes I am happy :)
I am bored. Is there an interesting cell to work on?
finish J-5 and I am pretty sure, J-6 will follow asap :D
I am, thanks!
Ok, I am out of ideas. I'll go to bed
summer = sun (a good bit where I am) and sometimes rain
which country? it's almost 8pm where i am.
hello i am back
I am now :)
I am!
I am playing it right now
Hm, I am not sure if this would ruin the *game*
Either that (probably better), or tell me here, if I am online
The reason I am asking:
What idiom is that? I am pretty sure, I didn't lose anything...
well i am missing one or two cubes in the challenge because i had the submitting error and was pissed of^^
so, I am off for a while ;)
(And I am fairly new to JS)
ok and chrome crashed, now I am here!
well i am not that good so that means i am out
i am not english either so dont worry about accuracy
alright I am back
I am
oh great, you can even see where I am
yes, the cube I am on is maybe a merger, or a very weird cell
sry, I am a slow writer :D
I am happy :)
but I am a dilentente player
Hi rprentki - I am trying to find the exit point of my branch, but I think, it'll work :D
so if you get where I am
I am currently breeding fruit flies in my ap bio.
It's based on accuracy and awesomeness... but I am never a trailblazer :(
na, I am too slow
yes, no I am happy :)
and where are you right now? I am in the US
I am new to this
i am 16 but will be 17 in 20 days
hey everyone I am back
i am confused lol
(That's why I said, Cimorelli is kinda different from what I am listening to) :-P
oh, now you're asking neuroscience stuff. I am out :D
It seems I am really lazy at other days
Ok, I am done for today :)
I am just stopping tracing.
i am not sure why, the number of users isn't abnormal
but I am the slow one
not same number, but the day when I am out of cubes as not dawned yet
but I am le tired...
I am slightly overusing those smileys ;)
I am mystified at being able to turn these cubes on their axes. I have no idea how they could have sliced the same cube three ways.
I am still on this one cube -.-
I am!
Wow, I am going to master english slang! :D
I mean, I am not submitting a cube "prematurely" because I am bored...
like the one I am at
but you have to be reasonable: sometimes I am disturbed by a child ... then I just click go on or I am half asleep...
oh, it's not an issue. I am just curious
I am on SAC. But I am only a super-chatter, not player ;)
Yes, I complimented Amy - I am allowed to play :)
hm, does that mean you can read my mind, or I am reading yours... that's a bit creepy, I have to say
Ah, I am pretty sure, I did it right. You know, wtc - only 12 cubes for the tutorial... *evilgrin*
everytime you ask these things I am afraid I have done something wrong
and of course sometimes I am tracing more than needed - but don't know until I submit I made a mistake and hope I am not messing it up
and again I am learning from you :D
and I am also missing a question mark. :/
is it just me or are the SAC cubes getting harder - I am doing terrible tonight
sometimes i worry that I am to bold and then I worry that I am to timid
well, I am finally out
maybe I am :P
who said I am :D
ok. Hope I am at home at 3pm...
aussies are really cute :P and now i am talking about the dogs
(re: 8 more hours) Crazy, you definitely ARE crazy. (And I am licensed to diagnose craziness, so there you go.)
I am starting to hate 2013.
truly?  because I am so afraid of adding wrongly
click over to OSAC1, I am about to reap the a merger
I am awesome today :)
Ok, I am afk again. Regenerating my superpowers...
but I am doing a prog calss at the same time though
oh, I am wrong... 51790 is correct... huh!
yeah, I am
ha yall actually saw it ha I am such a spaz on stage
yes I am
You know, I am just kidding. I like the chats, not the points :-P
But I am pretty sure they are going to lock it asap
i am
I had this cube I am 100I am sure this is, what hsseung would do know
I am not :)
I am trying to predict my results
here I am trying to make eyewire faster
I am still not sure, when chrome looks for new files by itself..
ok I think I am going to go work on personal projects for a few hours
I am still not sure if I understood your problem.
i am a banana
I am so confused
funny in 28 minutes I am going to watch my schools girl team play soccer
wait what i am so confused
I am not sure, but I thought, we only started the challenge with 3 seed pieces....
but I am used to click exact at the same spot all the time :D
I am on the J cell #7 is that good
hey, i am too! yey, more girs
i am a banana
i skip cubes when i think i am completely wrong and can't figure out a better way... but now i won't
I am not sure what you mean with "2 colours"
so.. I have high score colour, ketta was high score yesterday.. therefore, I am ketta!
I am good at weird...  lol
is there a way to rotate the 3d image of the cell created? i find i am having trouble distinguishing between a branch and a second cell
I am very new to this
I seem to be having the same fate 20 points. Not sure if I am doing something wrong or just my luck on the cubes I am getting.
Omg, I am on TV? :D
I think I just hit a merge. I am still in the cube. I pulled the /debug the Cube ID: 51118 Last seg: 4239. I will fig how to capture.
Umm... is it? I am sooo laaazy :D
If I think about it... maybe that's why I am not on team echo anymore :D
I am tutorializing! =D
I heard, that's actually something I am good at :)
It would seem I am missing a lot
Yes, I am. I got lucky though. That 80/msg ketta I am not a fan of holidays. Christmas is the worst for me. I'm off to make dinner(s) for the week. Good to *see* you welcome back
/msg nkem I am ALL
I am still wondering how you can tell that precise which piece belongs to a SAC...
geez, I'd be passing out. But you're younger then I am. I was better then too
I am pretty sure she said nm
he said once, but I am sure it wasn't a one time thing :(
as for anything visual, it won't work, they're both on the same model as i am
na, I am going to sleep as well :)
although I am longing for summer just now
yes, i am
I am
I am from Alaska
oh, reb - that's annoying - I am almost going to mute you :D
I'm off for a while, the kids could be 20 how overstimulated I am
I am not sure.
I am writing a small bot that does the work for me :D
I am so gonna be sick
ok, I am back - lets see if this works
i've only been doing SAC for a couple days. Is that why I am getting all these large, gnarly segments? not the usual long slender fingers...
sure? I am pretty sure, the really first day there were some popups missing...
I am pretty sure, he said that :D
maybe I am getting it somewhat correct since I'm getting 1122 points for Medusa -like cubes (ID 55737).
jared, where did you read that you get paid? I am still looking for the link
Someone told me that you get paid? I am confused now haha
I am fine thank you for asking.
hm, I am pretty sure, there is a large grey part that doesn't fit to my large grey part...
hm, I am pretty sure, there is a large grey part that doesn't fit to my large grey part...
